        <h3>System Unit Detailed!</h3>
        <p id="desktop">
            Why are some computers more powerful than others? The answer lies in three words: speed, capacity and
            flexibility. To understand this, you need to know the functionality of the basic components in the system
            unit, including the system board, microprocessors, memory, expansion slots and cards, bus lines, ports,
            cables, and power supply units. The <b>System Unit</b> also knwon as the <b>system chasis</b>, is a
            container that houses most of the electronic components that make up a computer system. In old generation
            computers, all system units were present in a separate case. Advances in the miniaturisation of electronic
            components, however, has led to smaller computers with system units that share containers with other parts
            of the computer system. As we have previously discussed, a <b>personal computer</b> is the most widely used
            equipment. It is the most affordable and is designed to be operated directly by an end user. The six most
            common types of computers are desktop, laptop, tablet, personal digital assistant (PDA), smartphones, and
            wearable computers. Each has a unique type of system unit.
        </p>

        <h3>Desktop</h3>
        <p>
            This is the most powerful type of personal computer. Most <b>desktops</b> have thier system unit in a
            separate case. This case contains the device's electronic components and selected secondary storage devices.
            Input and output devices, such as monitor, are located outside the system unit. This type of system unit is
            designed to be placed either horizontally or vertically are sometimes referred to as a <b>tower unit</b> or
            <b>tower computer</b>, see Figure 5-1. Some desktop computers' manufracturer, like HP, Lenovo and Dell have
            thier monitor and system unit housed together in the same case. These computers are known as an
            <b>all-in-one</b>, see Figure 5-2.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h3>Laptops</h3>
        <p>
            Laptops are portable, smaller, and as powerful as desktops. These systems units housed with selected
            secondary storage devices and input devices (keyword and pointing device). Located outside the system unit,
            the monitor is attached by hinges. There are several specialised laptops with features that make them
            unique. Some of these are:
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Two-in-one laptops</b>, which include a touch screen and the ability to fold flat like a tablet
            computer. These laptops offer the advantages of a laptop with the convenience of a tablet, see Figure 5-3.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="twoinone laptop.jpg" alt="" width="35%">
            <figcaption><b>Figure 5-3</b> Two-in-one laptop</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Gaming laptops</b>, which include high-end graphics hardware and very fast processors. At one time,
            most gamers preferred desktop computers. As laptops have become more powerful, gaming laptops have become
            the favourite primarily due to thier portability.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Ultrabooks</b>, also known as ultraportables or mini notebooks are lighter and thinner with longer
            battery life than most laptops. They accomplish these advantages by leaving out components such as optical
            drives and using energy-efficient microprocessors, see Figure 5-4.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h3>Tablets</h3>
        <p>
            Tablets, also known as <b>tablet computers</b>, are the newest and one of the most popular types of
            computer. They are, effectively, a thin slab with a wide-screen monitor and the system unit located just
            behind it. Tablets are smaller, lighter, and generally less powerful than laptop computers. Like a laptop,
            tablets have a flat screen but typically do not have a standard keyboard. Instead, most tablets use a
            virtual keyboard that appears on the screen and in touch-sensitive. While tablets are very convenient for
            watching videos or surfing the web, inputting information can be difficult using thier virtual keyboard.
            Some ways to overcome this limitation are with:
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Keyboard attachments</b>: Several manufracturers are offering keyboard options. For example, HP, Dell,
            Microsoft, Arteck, and Logitech offer wireless keyboards for tablets.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Digital pens</b>: These devices assist in selecting options and entering handwritten notes. For
            example, Microsoft, Samsung, iBall, Huawei and Lenovo offer tablets and digital pens.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Speech recoginition</b>: This advance feature allows direct verbal communication. For example, both
            Apple and Google feature excellent speech recoginition features built into iOS and Chrome OS.
        </p>

        <p id="pda">
            <b>Mini tablets</b> are a type of tablets with a smaller screen. While mini tablets operate like a
            traditional tablet, they typically do not have all the functionality of the bigger tablets. Thier most
            significant advantage is that they are easier to transport in pockets and purses, see Figure 5-5.
        </p>

        <h3>PDA</h3>
        <p id="smartphones">
            A <b>Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)</b> is a portable device that functions as a personal information
            manager. PDAs are used for web browsing, office applications, watching videos, viewing photos or as mobile
            phones. PDA model feature vary, but current common features include touch screen displays, Bluetooth and
            Wi-fi connectivity, memory card slots, mobile software applications and multimedia support. PDAs usually
            include personal information managers for contacts and schedules and always come with software to
            synchronise desktop or cloud server information.
        </p>

        <h3>Smartphones</h3>
        <p id="Wearablecomputers">
            <b>Smartphones</b> are by far the most popular mobile device. Designed to comfortably fit into the plam of
            one hand, smartphones have become the indispensable handheld computer. They greatly extend the capabilities
            of a cell phone by providing computing power. In addition to capturing and sendimg audio and video,
            smartphones run apps, connect to the Internet, and more. Thier system unit is located behind the display
            screen.
        </p>

        <h3>Wearable Computers</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Wearable Computers</b>, also known as <b>wearable devices</b>, are one of the first evolutionary steps to
            the IoT. These devices contain an embedded computers on a chip that is typically much smaller and less
            powerful than a smartphones's. The most common wearable computers are smartwatches and activtiy trackers,
            see Figure 5-6.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Smartwatches</b> like Google with android wear. These devices act as a watch, fitness monitor, and
            communication device. For example, Intex iRist is a smart Watch Phone with Camera. It has space for a SIM
            and SD card. One can make calls, send messages and download apps.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Activity trackers</b> like Fitbit's Charge 3, Fastrack Reflex, Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro. This device
            monitors daily exercise and sleep patterns. It also connects wirelessly to desktops, laptops, and
            smartphones to record and share data.
        </p>

        <p class="envo-b" id="components">
            <span class="envo-h">Environment üå¥</span> <br>
            Most people using computers never really turn off the device which wastes electricity that could have been
            saved and reduce the amount of burning of fossil fuel. Also computers are made of heavy metals and dangerous
            chemicals. These metals and chemicals contribute to global warming because from these discarded computers it
            causes water contamination and air pollution. Do you think people should stop purchasing computers and
            laptops, or is there any way out?
        </p>

        <h3>Components</h3>
        <p>
            Personal computers come in variety of sizes, shapes, and capabilities. While they look different and each
            has it own unique features, they share surpisingly similar components, including system boards,
            microprocessors, and memory, see Figure 5-7.
