        <p class="start-h2">Why should you read this page?</p>
        <p class="start-p1">Computers are getting sleeker, faster and extremely efficient. The bulky system unit has
            given way to small units with high speed, flexibility and capacity. Much like humans, on part of the
            computer's memory volatile (the RAM or random access memory) while the other is non-volatile (ROM or read
            only memory). While human memory gets updated with recent happening and earlier incidents get sketchy, the
            capacity of RAM is upgraded periodically. <br>
            â†’ This page covers the things you need to know to be prepared for this ever-changing digital world,
            including:</p>

        <p class="start-p3">â–¶ Tarun runs a grocery shop. He has been managing his accounts manually so far. But now
            wants to automate the billing process, stock availability and accounts. He also wants to install CCTV
            cameras. Tarun takes help of a local electronic goods seller who advices him to buy a laptop with a 500 GB
            hard disk drive, 8GB RAM with Windows 10 and four indoor CCTV cameras. He also advised Tarun to take a wi-fi
            connection with high speed connectivity. Within a few days wi-fi connection was installed and so were the
            computer and CCTV cameras. Tarun was now confident of growing his business.
