        <h2>Electronic Data and Instructions</h2>
        <p id="num-representation">
            Have you ever wondered why it is said that we live in a digital world? It's becuase computers cannot
            recognise information the same way you and I can. People follow instructions and process data using letters,
            numbers, and special characters. For example, if we wanted someone to add the numbers 3 and 5 together and
            record the answer, we might say 'please add 3 and 5.' The system unit, however, is electronic circuitry and
            cannot directly process such a request. Our voices create <b>analog,</b> or continuous, signals that vary to
            represent different tones, pitches, and volume. Computers, however, can recognise only <b>digital</b>
            electronic signals. Before any processing can occur within the system unit, a conversion must occur from
            what we understand to what the system unit can electronically process.

        <h3>Numeric Representation</h3>
        <p>
            What is the most fundamental statement you can make about electricity? It can be either on or off. Indeed,
            there are many forms of techonology that can make use of this two-state on/off, yes/no, present/absent
            arrangement. For instance, a light switch may be on or off, or an electric circuit open or closed. A
            specific location on a tape or disk may have a postitive charge or a negative charge. This is the reason,
            then that a two-state or binary system is used to represent data and instructions.

        <p id="character-encoding">
            The decimal system that we are all familiar with has 10 digits (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). The <b>binary
                system,</b> however consits of only two digits-0 and 1. Each 0 or 1 is called a <b>bit</b>-short for
            binary digit. In the system unit, the 1 can be represented by a negative charge and then by 0 by no electric
            charge. In order to represent numbers, letters, groups of eight called <b>bytes</b>. Whenever you enter must
            be converted into a binary number before it can be processed. Any number can be expressed as a binary
            number. Binary numbers, however, are difficult for humans to work with becuase they require often
            represented in a format more readable by humans. The <b>hexadecimal system</b>, or <b>hex</b>, uses 16
            digits (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F) to represent binary numbers. Each hex digit represent four binary
            digits and two hex digits are commonly used together to represent 1 byte (8 binary digits), see Table 5-5.
            You may have already seen hex when selecting a colour in a website design or drawing application, or when
            entering the password for access to a wireless network.

        <h3>Character Encoding</h3>
        <p>
            As we've seen, computers must represent all numbers with the binary system internally. What about text? How
            can a computer provide representation of non-numeric characters we use to communicate, such as the sentence
            you are reading now? The answer is character encoding schemes or standards. <b>Character encoding
                standards</b> assign a unique sequence of bits to each character. Historically, personal computers used
            the <b>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)</b> to represent characters, while
            mainframe computers used <b>EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code).</b> These schemes were
            quite effective; however, they are limited. ASCII, for example, only uses 7 bits to represent each
            character, which means that only 128 total character could be represented. This was fine for most characters
            in the English language but not large enough to support other languages such as Chinese and Japanese. These
            languages have too many characters to be represented by the 7-bit ASCII code.

        <p>
            The explosion of the Internet and subsequent globalisation of computing have led to a new character encoding
            called <b>Unicode</b>, which uses 16 bits. The Unicode standard is the most widely used character encoding
            standard and is recognised by virtually every computer system. The first 128 character are assigned the same
            sequence of bits as ASCII to maintain compatibility with older ASCii-formatted information. However, Unicode
            uses a variable number of bits to represent each character, which allows non-english characters and special
            characters to be represented. These codes are also called as Binary codes.
