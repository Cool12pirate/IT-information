                Computers are electronic devices that can follow instructions to accept input, process that input, and produce information. This book focuses principally on personal computers. 
                However, it is almost certain that you will come in contact, at least indirectly, with other types of computers.

            <h2>&#8886 Types of Computers &#8887</h2>
            <p>
                There are four types computers: personal computers, supercomputers, mainframe computers, and midrange computers.
            </p>
            <li>
                <b>Personal computers,</b>  also known as <b>PCs</b>, are the least powerful, yet the most widely used and fastest-growing type of computers: <i>desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones,</i> 
                and <i>wearables.</i> <b>Desktop computers</b> are small enough to fit on top of or alongside a desk yet are too big to carry around, see Figure 1-5. <!--add fig 1-5--> <b>Laptop 
                computers,</b> also knwon as <b>notebook computers,</b> are portable and lightweight and fit into most briefcase, see Figure 1-6. <b>Tablets,</b> also knwon as <b>Tablet computers,</b> 
                are smaller, lighter, and generally less powerful than laptops. Like laptops, tablets have a flat screen but typically do not have a standard keyboard, virtual keyboard that appears on the 
                screen and is touch-sensitive. <b>Smartphones</b> are the most widely used handheld computers. Smartphones are cell phones with wireless connections to the Internet and processing capabilities, 
                see Figure 1-8. Other mobile computers include <b>wearable devices </b> like <b>Smart Watch (Apple watch)</b>, see Figure 1-9.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Supercomputers</b> are the most powerful type of computers. These machines are special, high-capacity computers used by very large organisations. Supercomputers are typically 
                used to store and process massive amounts of data. For example, they are used to analyse and predict worldwide weather patterns. IBM's Blue Gene and CDAC's PARAM are two of the 
                fastest computers in the world, see Figure 1-10. <!--Add figure-->
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Mainframe computers</b> occpy specially wired, air-conditioned rooms. Although not nearly as powerful as supercomputers, mainframe computers are capable of great processing speeds  
                and data storage. For example, insurance compaines use mainframe to process information about millions of policyholders.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Midrange computers,</b> also referred to as servers, are computers with processing capabilities less powerful than a mainframe computer yet more powerful than a personal computer. 
                Originally used by medium-size companies or departments of large compaines to support thier processing needs, today midrange computers are most widely used to support or serve end 
                users for such specific needs as retrieving data from a database or supplying access to application software.

            <h2>&#8886 Personal Computers Hardware &#8887</h2>
            <p>
                Hardware for a personal computer system consits of a variety of different devices. This physical equipment falls into four basic categories: system unit, input/output, secondary 
                storage, and communication. Because we discuss hardware in detail later in this book, here we will present just a quick overview of the four basic categories. 
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>System unit:</b> The <b>System unit</b> is a container that houses most of the electronic components of a computer system. Two important components of the system unit are 
                <i>microprocessors</i> and <i>memory,</i> see Figure 1-11. The <b>microprocessor</b> controls and manipulates data to produce information. <b>Memory</b> is a holding are for data,
                instructions, and information. One type, <b>random-access memory (RAM)</b>, holds the program and data that is currently being processed. This type of memory is sometimes referred 
                to as <i>temporary storage</i> because its contents will typically be lost if the electric power to the computer is distrupted. Second type, <b>read-only memory (ROM)</b>, is the 
                computer memory where data is prerecorded. Contents are retained on ROM even when the computers is turned off.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Input/output: Input devices</b> translate data and programs that human can understand into a form that the computer can process. The most common input devices are the <b>keyboard</b> 
                and the <b>mouse. Output devices</b> translate the processed information from the computer into a form that humans can understand. The most common output device in the <b>display,</b> 
                also known as a <b>monitor.</b>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Secondary storage:</b> Unlike memory, <b>secondary storage</b> holds data and programs even after electric power to the computer system has been turned off. The most important kinds of 
                secondary media are <i>hard disk, pen drives, removable hard disks, solid-state storage,</i> and <i>optical discs.</i>
            </li>

            <p>
                <span style="margin-left: 5%;"><b>Hard disks</b></span> are typically used to store program and very large data files. Using rigid metallic platters and read/write heads that move 
                across the platters, data and information are stored using magnetic charges on the disk's surface. In contrast, <b>solid-state storage</b> does not have any moving parts, is more 
                reliable, and requires less power. It saves data and information electrnoically similar to RAM except that it is not volatile, see Figure 1-12. <b>Optical discs</b> use laser technology 
                to store data and programs. Three types of optical discs are <b>compact discs (CDs), digital versatile (or video) discs (DVDs),</b> and <b>Blu-ray discs (BD)</b>. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;"><b>Pen drive</b></span> or a USB flash drive, is a portable data stoarge device. It is a handy device designated to transfer information from one 
                computer to another in a short time. It comes with storage from 4GB till 2 TB and are frequently available in market.
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>Communication:</b> At one time, it was uncommon for a personal computer system to communicate with other computer systems. Now, using <b>communication devices,</b> a personal 
                computer routinely communicates with other computer system located near as the next office or as far away as halfway around the world, using the Internet. A <b>modem</b> is a widely 
                used communication device that modifies audio, video, and other types of data into a form that can be transmitted across the Internet.
