            <p>
                Software, as we mentioned, is another name for a program. A program is a set of instructions that tell a computer how to process data into the form you want. In most cases, the words <i>software</i> 
                and <i>program</i> are interchangeable. There are two major kinds of software: <i>system software</i> and <i>application software</i>. Application software (apps) are created for specific use of end 
                users. System software are designed to run computers.

                The user interacts with application software. <b>System software</b> enables the application software to interact with the computer hardware. System software is 'background' software 
                that helps the computer manage its own internal resources. <br>
                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">System</span> software is not a single program. Rather, it is a collection of programs, including the following:

                <b>Operating System</b> are program that coordinate computer resources, provide an interface between users and the computer, and run applications. Smartphones, tablets, and many other mobile 
                devices are <b>embedded operating systems,</b> also known as <b>real-time operating system (RTOS).</b> Desktop computers use <b>stand-alone operating systems</b> like Windows 10 and macOS, see 
                Figure 1-2 and 1-3. Networks use <b>network operating systems (NOS).</b>

                <b>Utilities</b> perform specific tasks related to managing computer resources. One of the most essential utility program that every computer system should have is an antivirus program. 
                This program protects your computer system from <b>viruses</b> or malicious programs that are all too often deposited onto your computer from the Internet. This program can damage software 
                and hardware, as well as compromise with security and privacy of your personal data. If your computer does not have an antivirus program installed on it, you need to get one. To see how you 
                can install a free antivirus program on your computer, see Making IT work for You: Free Antivirus Program <!--Insert link of page 12 & 13-->.

                <b>Device drivers</b> are specialised programs designed to allow particular input or output devices to communicate with the rest of the computer system.
