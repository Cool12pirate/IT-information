            <h1>&#9769 Connectivity and Mobile Internet</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Connectivity</b> is the capability of your personal computer to share information with other computers. Central to the concept of connectivity is the network. A network is a 
                communication system connecting two or more computers. The largest network in the world is the <b>Internet.</b> It is like a giant highway that connect you to millions of 
                other people and organisations located throughout the world. The web provides a multimedia interface to the numerous resources available on the Internet, for example online shopping 
                is one such revolution in Internet technology which has utilised this connectivity in best possible manner. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">The Internet</span> has driven the evoluation of computers and thier impact on daily lives. In fact, the rate of technology change is accelerating at an 
                ever faster pace. Along with the Internet, Three things that are driving the inpact of technology on our lives are cloud computing, wireless communication, and the Internet of Things.

                <b>Cloud computing</b> uses the Internet and the web to shift many computer activities from a user's computer to computers on the Internet. Rather than replying solely on thier 
                computer, users can now use the Internet to connect to the cloud and access more powerful computers, software, and storage. Common examples of cloud storage are Google Drive, Dropbox, WeTransfer, etc. 
                These allow storage of our personal and non-personal files, documents, pictures, video securely on the Internet with options to share them with others and also to download on our devices whenever 
                necessary. Small storage requirements are free, however, extra space requirements and features are paid services.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Wireless communication</b> has changed the way we communicate with one another. The rapid development and widespread use of wireless communication devices like tablets, smartphones, and 
                wearable devices has led many experts to predict that wireless applications are just the beginning of the wireless revolution, a revolution that will dramatically affect the way we communicate 
                and use computer technology.
            </li>

            <li>
                The <b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b> is the continuing development of the Internet that allows everyday objects embedded with electronic devices to send and receive data over the Internet. 
                It promises to connect all types of devices from computers to smartphones to watches to any number of everyday devices. For example, live transmission via CCTV installed at home can be 
                viewed by parents on thier mobile any time from thier office when thier children are alone at home. A farmer can control water pump installed at his farm remotely from his home.
            </li>

            <p>
                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Wireless</span> communication, cloud computing, and IoT are driving the mobile Internet. They promise to continue to dramatically affect the entire computer 
                industry and how you and I will interact with computers and other devices.
