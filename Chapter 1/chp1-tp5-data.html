            <p>
                <b>Data</b> is raw, unprocessed facts, including text, numbers, images, and sounds. As we mentioned earlier, processed data becomes information. When stored electronically in files, data 
                can be used directly as an input for the system unit. Four common types of files, see Figure 1-13, are:
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>Document files,</b> created by word processors to save documents such as memos, term papers, and letters.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Worksheet files,</b> created by electronic spreadsheets to analyse things like budgets and to predict sales.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Database files,</b> typically created by database management programs to contain highly structured and organised data. For example, an employee database file might contain all the worker's 
                names, family details, address, and other related pieces of information. 
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Presentation files,</b> created by presentation graphics to save presentation materials. For example, a file might contain audience handouts, speaker notes, and electronic slides.
            </li>
        </div>
