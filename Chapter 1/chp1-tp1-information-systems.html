                When you think of a personal computer (PC), perhaps you just think of the equipment, such as the screen or the keyboard. Yet, there is more to a personal computer than that. The best 
                way to think about a personal computer is as part of an <b>information system</b>. An information system have serveral parts: <i>people, procedures, software, hardware, data,</i> and 
                <i>the Internet,</i> see Figure 1-1.

                <b>People:</b> It is easy to overlook people as one of the parts of an information systems. Yet this is what personal computer are all about-making <b>people, end users</b> like you, 
                more productive.

                <b>Procedures:</b> The rules or guidelines which are to be followed by people when using software, hardware, and data are known as <b>procedures</b>. These procedures are typically 
                documented in manuals written by computer specialists. Software and hardware manufactures provide manuals with thier products. These manuals are provided in printed or electronic form.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Software:</b> A <b>program</b> is a step-by-step instruction that tell a computer how to do its work. <b>Software</b> is another name for a program or programs. The purpose of 
                software is to convert <b>data</b> (unprocessed facts) into <b>information</b> (processed facts). For example, a payroll program would instruct the computer to take the number of 
                hours you worked in a month (data) and multiply it by your pay rate (data) to determine how much you are paid for the month (information).
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Hardware:</b> The equipment that processes the data to create information is called <b>hardware</b>. It includes smartphones, tablets, keyboards, mouse, displays, system units, and other 
                devices. Hardware is controlled by software.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Data:</b> The raw, unprocessed facts, including text, numbers, images, sounds, etc. are called <b>data</b>. Processed data yields information. Using the previous example of a payroll 
                program, the data (number of hours worked and pay rate) is processed (multiplied) to yield information (monthly pay).
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Internet:</b> Almost all information systems connect and interact with other people and computers. THis is done by the <b>Internet</b>. This connectivity greatly expands the 
                capability the usefulness of information systems.
