        <h2>Ergonomics</h2>
        <p>
            People use computers to enrich thier personal and professional lives. There are ways, however, that
            computers can make people less productive and even harm thier health. Anyone who frequently uses a computer
            can be affected. As a result, there has been great interest in a field known as ergonomics.
            <b>Ergonomics</b> (pronounced 'er-guh-nom-lx') is defined as the study of human factors related to things
            people use. It is concerned with fitting the task to the user rather than forcing the user to do the task.
            For computer users and manufracturers this means designing input and output devices to increase ease of use
            and decreases health risks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sitting in front of a screen in awkward positions for long periods may lead to physical problems such as
            eyestrain, headaches, and back pain. Computer users can alleviate these problems by taking frequent rest
            breaks and by using well-designed computers furniture. Some recommendations by ergonomics experts are
            illustrated in Figure 6-30. Other recommendations to avoid physical discomfort are:
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Eyestrain and headache</b>: To make the computer easier on the eyes, take a 15-minuntes break every
            hour or two. Keep everthing you're focusing on at about the same distance. For example, the computer screen,
            keyboard, and a document holder containing your might be positioned about 20 inches away. Clean the screen
            of dust from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Back and neck pain</b>: To help avoid back and neck problems, make sure your equipment is adjustable.
            You should be able to adjust your chair for height and angle, and the chair should have good back support.
            The monitor should be at eye level or slightly below eye level. Use a footrest, if necessary, to reduce leg
            fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Repetitive strain injury</b>: Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is any injury that is caused by fast,
            repetitive work that can generate neck, wrist, hand, and arm pain. RSI is by far the greatest cause of
            workplace illnesses, resulting in lost productivity every year. One particular type of RSI, <b>carpal tunnel
                syndrome</b>, found amoung heavy computer users, consists of damage to nerves and tendons in the hands.
            Some victims report the pain is so intense that they cannot open doors or shake hands and that they require
            corrective surgery. Ergonomically correct keyboards have been developed to help prevent injury from heavy
            computer use, see Figure 6-31. In addition to using ergonomic keyboards, you should take frequent short rest
            breaks and gently massage your hands.
        </p>

        <h3>Portable Computers</h3>
        <p>
            Although these recommendations apply to all personal computers, the design of portable computers, including
            laptops, tablets, and smartphones, presents some specific ergonomic challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Laptops</b>: Almost all laptops have attached keyboards and screens. Unfortunately, it is impossible to
            optimally position either for safe ergonomic use. When the screen is positioned appropriately at eye level,
            the keyboard is too high. When the keyboard is appropriately positioned, the screen is too low. To minimise
            the negative impact, raise the level of the screen by using books or reams of pape under the laptop and
            attach an external keyboard to be used at waist level.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Tablets</b>: Almost all tablets use a virtual keyboard and are designed to be held in your hands, flat
            on a table, or slightly angled. These design features cause the user to improperly allign his or her head to
            the viewing surface, often causing neck and back pain. This problem, sometimes referred to as <em>tabelt
                hunch</em>, can be minimised by taking frequent breakes, moving around while working, using a tablet
            cover or stand that allows the screen to be tipped at various angles, and using an external keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Smartphones</b>: Today, smartphones are more likely to be used for texting than talking. As a result,
            thumbs are often used to type on a tiny keyboard. The result can be a pain at the base or in the muscles of
            the thumb or wrist. This problem can be minimised by keeping wrists straight (not bent), head up, and
            shoulders straight and frequently resting thumbs by using other fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In today's world, it is important to protect yourself by using computers appropriately.
