        <h2>Output Devices</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Output</b> is processed data or information. Output typically takes the form of text, graphics, photos,
            audio, and/or video. For example, when you create a presentation using a presentation graphics program, you
            typically input text and graphics. You also could include photographs, voice narration, and even video. The
            output would be the completed presentation. <b>Output Devices</b> are any hardware used to provide or to
            create output. They translate information than has been processed by the system unit into a form that humans
            can understand. There are a wide range or output devices. The most widely used are monitors, printers, and
            audio-output devices.
        </p>

        <h2>Monitors</h2>
        <p>
            The most frequently used output device is a <b>monitor</b>. Also knwon as <b>display screens</b>, monitors
            present visual images of text and graphics. The output is often referred to as <b>soft copy</b>. Monitors
            vary in size, shape, and cost. Almost all have some basic distinguishing features.
        </p>

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>
            The most important characteristic of a monitor is its clarity. <b>Clarity</b> refers to the quality and
            sharpness of the displayed images. It is a function of several monitor features, including resolution, dot
            pitch, contrast ratio, size, and aspect ratio.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Resolution</b> is one of the most important feature. Images are formed on a monitor by a series of dots
            or <b>pixels (picture elements)</b>, see Figure 6-15. Resolution is expressed as a matrix of these dots or
            pixels. For example, many monitors today have a resolution of 1,920 pixel columns by 1,080 pixel rows for a
            total of 2,073,600 pixels. The higher a monitor's resolution (the more pixels), the clearer the image
            produced. Refer Table 6-1 for the most common monitor resolutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Dot (pixel) pitch</b> is the distance between each pixel. Most newer monitors have a dot pitch of 0.30
            mm (30/100th of a milimeter) or less. The lower the dot pitch (the shorter the distance between pixels), the
            clearer the images produced.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Contrast ratios</b> indicate a monitor's ability to display images. It compare the light intensity of
            the brightest white to the darkest black. The higher the ratio, the better the monitor. Good monitors
            typically have contrast ratios between 500:1 and 2000:1.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Size,</b> or <b>active display area</b>, is measured by the diagonal length of a monitor's viewing
            area. Common sizes are 15, 17, 19, 21, and 24 inches.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Aspect Ratio</b> indicates the proportional relationship between a display's width and hight.
            Typically, this relationship is expressed by two numbers separated by a colon (:). Many older, more
            square-shaped monitors, have a 4:3 aspect ratio. Almost all newer monitors have a 16:9 aspect ratio designed
            to display wide-screen content.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another important monitors feature is the ability to accept touch or gesture input such as finger movements
            including swiping sliding, and pinching. While most older monitors do not support touch input, it is
            becoming a standard feature of newer monitors.

        <h3>Flat-Panel Monitor</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Flat-panel monitor</b> are widely used today. Compared to other types, they are thinner, portable, and
            require less power to operate, see Figure 6-16. Almost all flat-panel displays are backlit, meaning that a
            common source of light is dispersed over all pixels on the screen. There are three basic types of flat-panel
            monitors: LCD, LED, and OLED.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)</b> is widely used for older monitors and is typically less expensive.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>LED (Light-Emitting Diode)</b> monitors use similar technology with a more advanced backlighting
            technology. They produce better-quality images, are slimmer, and are more environmentally friendly as they
            require less power and use fewer toxic chemicals to manufracture. Most new monitors are LED.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode)</b> monitors replace the LED monitor's backlighting technology with
            a thin layer of organic compound that produces light. By eliminating the backlight, OLED monitors can even
            thinner with better power efficiency and contrast ratios.

        <p class="tip-b">
            <span class="tip-h">Tips</span> <br>
            Do your photos and videos look different depending on what screen you use? It may be due to different video
            settings. TV and Computer monitors come from the factory with standard settings. To get the best performance
            from a monitor, you should calibrate the display. <br> <br>

            <b>1.</b> <b>Before you calibrate</b> : Many factors can change a monitor's response to calibration. To
            ensure that you have a proof baseline before file-tuning your device, consider these factors before
            calibration: <br>
            ‚óè Warm up the TV or monitor. Allow the display to warm up for half an hour before calibration. <br>
            ‚óè Set the display resolution to its default (or native) resolution. <br>
            ‚óè Calibrate in a room with ambient light. Direct light on the screen can make it difficult to accurately
            assess your display's picture quality. <br> <br>

            <b>2.</b> <b>Select your picture mode</b> : Found within the display or monitor's settings, a picture mode
            is a collection of preset profiles that adjusts the display to work well with different types of content.
            With categories like cinema, sports, games, and dynamic, these preset configurations change display
            settings, including color temperature, brightness, and contrast, to customise the display to the viewer's
            preference. For true color representation, look for THX or ISF modes; failing that, use cinema or theater
            mode. <br> <br>

            <b>3.</b> <b>Use software tools</b> : To truly maximise your display for its surrounding environment, you
            will need to fine-tune its callibration. For computer monitors, both Windows and macOS come with free
            monitor callibration tools in the control panel or system preferences of your computer. Many TV
            manufractures offer free setup tools as well-check the manual and software that came with your TV. Finally,
            you can purchase callibration tools, such as the THX Tune-up from THX.

        <h3>Curved Monitors</h3>
        <p>
            One of the most recent developments is the <b>curved monitors</b>. It uses similar technology as flat-panel
            monitors except it has a concav screen that provides better viewing angles near the edges of the screen.
            Curved monitors are widely used for high-end television experience, see Figure 6-17. Curved monitors are
            just beginning to appear in smartphones, curved monitors allow the screen to wrap around the edge of the
            phone for alternative display and button options. For smartwatches, a curved screen allows for large
            displays that contour to the shape of your wrist. The best curved monitors are from Samsung, Asus, Acer and
            Allenware.
        </p>

        <h3>E-Book Reader</h3>
        <p>
            <b>E-books (electronic books)</b> are traditional printed books in electronic format. These books are
            available from numerous sources, including many public and private libraries, bookstore websites, and the
            cloud. <b>E-book readers (e-readers)</b> are dedicated mobile devices for storing and displaying e-books and
            other electronic media, including electronic newspapers and magazines. E-book readers have displays that are
            typically 6 inches and use a technology known as e-ink. <b>E-ink</b> produces images that reflect like
            ordinary paper, making the display easy to read. Two well-known e-book readers are Amazon's Kindle and
            Infibeam Pi, see Figure 6-18. Tablets can also display e-books. They are larger, heavier, and more expensive
            than e-books readers. They are also much more flexible, with displaying e-books being only one of thier any
            number of applications. Unlike dedicated e-books readers, these tablets use LCD displays the provide crisp,
            colourful images; however, they are difficult to read in bright light due to thier reflective nature.
            Two-well known traditional tablets are Samsung's Galaxy Tab, Lenovo Tab 4 and HCL.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Monitors</h3>
        <p>
            There are other types of monitors as well. Some are used for more specialised applications, such as making
            presentations and watching television.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Digital</b> or <b>interactive whiteboards</b> are specialised devices with a large display connected to
            a computer or projector. The computer's desktop is displayed on the digital wihteboard and controlled using
            a special pen, a finger, or some other device. Digital whiteboards are widely used in classrooms and
            corporate boardrooms.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Ultra-High-Definition Television (UHDTV)</b> delivers a much clearer and more detailed wide-screen
            picture than regular HDTV. Because the output is digital, users can readily freeze video sequences to create
            high-quality still images. The video and still images can then be edited and stored for later use. This
            technology is very useful to graphic artists, designers, and publishers. One of the most recent and dramatic
            advances in 3D UHDTV, see Figure 6-19. Using special viewing glasses, 3D UHDTV provides therater-quality
            three-dimensional viewing.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Digital projector</b> project the images from a traditional monitor onto a screen or wall. This is
            ideal for presentation or meetings when several people need to see the screen at the same time. Further,
            projectors tend to be more portable and less expensive than a similarly sized monitor. Unfortunately,
            projected images can be difficult to see in bright rooms, so they are best used in dark rooms with curtains
            or no windows, see Figure 6-20.
        </p>
