        <h2>Audio Input Devices</h2>
        <p id="vrs">
            <em>Audio-input devices</em> convert sounds into a form that can be processed by the system unit. By far the
            mst widely used audio-input devices in the microphone. Audio input can take many forms, including the human
            voice and music.
        </p>

        <h3>Voice Recoginition Systems</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Voice recoginition systems</b> use a microphone, a sound card, and special software. These systems allow
            users to operate computers and other devices as well as to create documents using voice commands. As
            discussed in <a href="file:///C:/Users/user/Documents/Chapter%204/index.html">Chapter 4</a>, most
            smartphones include a digital assisatnt that uses voice recoginition to accept voice commands to control
            operations. Windows phones come with Cortana, Google phones come with Google Now and Apple phones come with
            Siri. These voice recoginition systems, see Figure 6-14, can perform any number of operations, including
            scheduling events on your calendar, composing simple text messages, and looking up facts on the web.
            Specialised portable voice recorders are widely used by doctors, lawyers, and others to record dictation.
            These devices are able to record for several hours before connecting to a computer running voice
            recoginition software to edit, store, and print the dictated information. Some systems are even able to
            translate dictation from one language to another, such as from English to Japanese.
