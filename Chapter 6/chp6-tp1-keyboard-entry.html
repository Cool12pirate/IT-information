        <h2>Keyboard Entry</h2>
        <p id="keyboard">
            One of the most common ways to input data is by using a <b>keyboard</b>. As mentioned previously , keyboards
            convert numbers, letters, and special characters that people into electrical signals. These signals are sent
            to, and processed by the system unit. Most keyboards use an arrangement of keys given the name QWERTY. This
            name reflects the keyboard layout by taking the letters of the first six alphabetic characters found on the
            top row of keys displaying letters.
        </p>

        <h3>Keyboard</h3>
        <p>
            There are a wide variety of keyboard designs. They range from full-sized to miniature and can even be
            virtual. There are four basic categories of keyboards: traditional, laptop, virtual, and thumb.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Traditional keyboards:</b> These full-size keyboards are widely used on desktops and larger computers.
            The standard U.S. traditional keyboard has 101 keys. Some traditional keyboards include a few additionl
            special keys. For example, the Windows keyboard include a Windows key to directly access the Start menu.
            Traditional keyboards provide functional keys, navigation keys, and numeric keypad. Some keys, such as the
            Caps Lock key, are <b>Toggle keys</b>. These keys turn a feature on or off. Others such as thr Ctrl key, are
            <b>combination keys</b>, which perform an action when held down in combination with another key, see Figure
            6-1.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Laptop keyboards</b>: These keyboards are smaller than traditional keyboards and are widely used with
            laptop computers. While the precise location and number of keys may differ amoug manufractures, laptop
            keyboards typically have fewer keys, do not include a numeric keypad, and do not have a standard location
            for the function and navigation keys, see Figure 6-2.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Virtual Keyboard</b>: These keyboards are used primarily with mobile devices and tablets. Unlike other
            keyboards, virtual keyboards do not have a physical keyboard. Rather, the keys are typically displayed on a
            screen and selected by touching thier image on the screen, see Figure 6-2.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Thumb keyboards</b>: These keyboards are used on smartphones and other smaller screen mobile devices.
            Designed primarily for communicating via texting and connecting to the web, these keyboards are very small,
            see Figure 6-2.
