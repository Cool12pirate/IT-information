            Input and output devices have seen staggering advances in recent years. A typical smartphone now has dozens
            of input sensors and display options. In the future, input devices such as tiny attachments to cloths or
            eyewear will likely be as common as smartphones. Augmented reality displays or wearable glasses will
            integrate what you see with extensive databases of relevant information. <br>
            This page covers the things you need to know to be prepared for this ever-changing digital world, including:

            â–¶ Sarthak had to get some printouts, he asked his friends Kunal to accompany him. While they were waiting
            Kunal asked Sarthak a very interesting question-"How does a printer work?" Sarthak was well aware of the
            input and output devices so he explained him that the laser beam builds a pattern of static electricity by
            moving to and from inside a printer which forms linking of ink and the page, resulting in the print. Not
            only Kunal but the rest of the people standing in the shop were also impressed by his knowledge.

            <h3>Input and Output Devices</h3>
            <p class="start-p4">
                <b>Input</b> is any data or instructions that are used by a computer. They can directly from you or from
                other sources. You provide input whenever you use system or application programs. For example, when
                using a word processing program, you enter data in the form of numbers and letters and issue commands
                such as to save and to print documents. You also can enter data and issue commands by pointing to items
                or using your voice. Other sources of input include scanned or photographed images. <b>Input devices</b>
                are hardware used to translate in words, numbers, sounds, images, and gestures that people understand
                into a form that the system unit can process. For example, when using a word keyboard and mouse, there
                are a wide variety of other input devices. These include pointing scanning, image capturing, and
                audio-input devices.
