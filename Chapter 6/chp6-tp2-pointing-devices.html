        <h2>Pointing Devices</h2>
        <p id="mouse">
            <b>Pointing devices</b> provide an intuitive interface with the system unit by accepting physical movements
            or gestures such as a finger pointing or moving across a screen and converting these movements into
            machine-readable input. There are a wide variety of pointing devices, including the mouse, touch screen,
            game controller, and stylus.
        </p>

        <h3>Mouse</h3>
        <p>
            A mouse controls a pointer that is displayed on the monitor. The <b>mouse pointer</b> usually appears in the
            shape of an arrow. It frequently changes shape, however, depending on the application. A mouse can have one,
            two, or more buttons, which are used to select command options and to control the mouse pointer on the
            mouse. Some mouse have a <b>wheel button</b> that can rotated to scroll through information that is
            displayed on the monitor. Although there are several different designs, the <b>optical mouse</b> is the most
            widely used, see Figure 6-3. It emits and senses light to detect mouse movement. Traditionally, the detected
            movements are communicated to the system unit through a cord. Alternatively, the <b>cordless</b> or
            <b>wireless mouse</b> uses radio waves or infrared light waves to communicate with the system unit. These
            devices eliminate the mouse cord and free up desk space. Like a mouse, a <b>touch pad</b>, see Figure 6-4,
            is used to control the mouse pointer and to make selections. Unlike a mouse, however, a touch pad operates
            by moving or tapping the finger on the surface of a pad. These devices are widely used instead of a mouse
            with laptops and some types of mobile devices.
        </p>

        <p class="pri-b">
            <span class="pri-h">Privacy</span> <br>
            The Xbox One and the PS4 are popular gaming consoles that can be upgraded with the addition of a camera and
            microphone that allow player to control games by waving thier hands or speaking commands. These popular
            add-ons offer a new method of input to the player, but privacy advocates suggest that these simple games may
            be an invitation for snooping hackers or overreaching goverments. They warn that if these devices are not
            popular secured and managed, they can offer cyber criminals a live microphone and camera in the living room
            of millions of gamers. Do you think that these gaming input devices are simply a harmless diversion, or are
            we installing the spy devices that will be used broadcast our private live across the Internet?
        </p>

        <h3>Touch Screen</h3>
        <p>
            A <b>touch screen</b> allows users to select actions or commands by touching the screen with a finger or
            penlike device. <b>Multi-touch screens</b> can be touched with more than one finger, which allows for
            interactions such as rotating graphical objects on the screen with your hand or zooming in and out by
            pinching and streching your fingers. Multitouch screens are commonly used with tablets and smartphones, as
            well as some laptop computers and desktop monitors.
        </p>

        <h3>Game Controllers</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Game controllers</b> are devices that provide input to computer games. While keyboards and traditional
            mouse can be used as game controllers, the four most popular and specialised game controllers are joysticks,
            gaming mouse, gaming pads, and motion-sensing devices, see Figure 6-5.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Joysticks</b> control game actions by users varying the pressure, speed, and direction of a control
            stick.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Gaming</b> mouse are similar to traditional mouse with higher precision, faster responsiveness,
            programmable buttons, and better ergonomics.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Gamepads</b> are designed to be held by two hands and provide a wide array of inputs including motion,
            turning, stopping, and firing.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Motion-sensing devices</b> control games by user movements. For example, Microsoft's Kinect
            motion-sensing device accepts user movements and spoken commands to control games on the Xbox 360.
        </p>

        <h3>Stylus</h3>
        <p>
            A <b>stylus</b> is a penlike device typically used with tablets and mobile devices, see Figure 6-6. A stylus
            uses pressure to draw images on a screen. Often, a stylus interacts with the computers handwriting
            recognition software. <b>Handwriting recognition software</b> translates handwritten notes into a form that
            the system unit can process.
