    <div class="main">
        <h2>Audio-Output Devices</h2>
        <p>
            Audio-output devices translate audio information from the computer into sounds that people can understand.
            The most widely used audio-output devices are <b>speakers</b> and <b>headphones</b>, see Figure 6-25. These
            devices connect to a sound card within the system unit. This connection can be established by cable to an
            audio jack on the system unit, or the connection can be wireless. Wireless connections system unit, or the
            connection can be wireless. Wireless connections typically use <b>Bluetooth</b> techonology. This type of
            connection require special Bluetooth-enabled speakers and/or headphones. The sound card is used to capture
            as well as play back recorded sounds. Audio-output devices are used to play music, vocalise translation from
            one language to another, and communicate information from the computer system to users. Several
            wireless-wifi devices are Google Assistant, Alexa, microphon, bluetooth, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Combination Input and Output Devices</h2>
        <p>
            Many devices combine input and output capabilities. Sometimes this is done to save space. Other times it is
            done for very specialised applications. Common combination devices include headsets, multifunctional
            devices, virtual reality head-mounted displays and controllers, drones, and robots.
        </p>

        <h3>Headsets</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Headsets</b> combine the functionality of microphones and headphones. The microphone accepts audible
            input, and headphones provide audio output. Headsets are an integral part of serious video games systems,
            see Figure 6-26.
        </p>

        <h3>Multifunctional Devices</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Multifunctional Devices (MFD)</b> typically combine the capabilities of a scanner, printer, fax, and copy
            machine. These multifunctional devices offer a cost and space advantage. They cost about the same as a good
            printer or copy machine, but require much less space than the single-function devices they replace. Thier
            disadvantages are lower quality and unreliability. The output quality for any one function is often not
            quite as good as that of the output quality for any one function is often not quite as good as that of the
            separate single-purpose devices. The reliability of multifunctional devices suffers because problems with
            one of the functional parts can make the entire device inoperable. Even so, multifunctional devices are
            widely used in home and small business offices.
        </p>

        <h3>Telephone</h3>
        <p>
            Telephones are input and output devices for receiving and sending voice communication. <b>Voice over IP
                (VoIP) </b> is a set of standard or technologies that support voice and other types of communication
            over the Internet. <b>Telephony</b>, also known as <b>internet Telephony</b>, is the VoIP application that
            uses Internet rather than traditional lines to support voice communication. There are many VoIP services
            available for free that do not require any dedicated hardware. Examples of these services are Skype from
            Microsoft and Hangouts from Google. Once you subscribe to a service, you can use your smartphone or other
            type of computer to connect to any other subscriber. These services are free and support video as well as
            audio; however, both parties must have thier computers on and be logged in to the service to send and
            receive calls. For an additional fee, Skype allows you to call non-Skype subscribers directly on thier
            phone.
        </p>

        <h3>Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays and Controllers</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Virtual Reality (VR)</b> is an artifical, or simulated, reality created in 3D by computers. It strives to
            create a virtual or <b>immersive experience</b> by using specialised hardware that includes a head-mounted
            display and controller, see Figure 6-27.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Vr head-mounted displays</b> have earphones for immersive sound, stereoscopic screens to present 3D
            images, and gyroscopic sensors to interpret head orientation.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>VR controllers</b> have sensors that collect data about your hand movments. Coupled with software, this
            is interactive sensory equipment lets you immerse yourself in a computer-generated world.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are any number of applications for virtual reality head-mounted displays and controllers. Automobile
            manufractures use virtual reality to evaluate what it would be like to sit in the cars they have designed
            but not yet built. Recently released virtual reality hardware for gaming consoles and high-end PCs look to
            revolutionise the way we work and play. Virtual reality promises to become commonplace in the near future.
            To learn more about VR head-mounted displays-controllers.
        </p>

        <h3>Drones</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Drones</b> were once too expensive for anything but military budget. However, today's drones are
            inexpensive, faster, and smarter, making them a valuable tool and fun high-tech toy, see Figure 6-28. Drones
            were most commonly called as RPA (remotely Piloted Aircraft), ROA (Remotely Operated Aircraft), UAS
            (Unmanned Aircraft System) or FAA (Federal Aviation Administration). But today the common term for drone is
            UAV i.e. Unamnned Arial Vehical. Drones can fly either in a straight line or around in circles. Most drones
            take input from a controller from either or a ratio joystick or a Wi-Fi connected tablet or laptop. The
            drones act as an output device, sending back video and sound to the user. The resulting combination of video
            and aerial maneuverability has made drones a popular choice for a wide variety of activities ranging from
            amateur cinematographers to civil engineers. Drone use is on the rise by all types of users. Drones are used
            in agriculture to apply pesticides and monitor livestock, in disaster relief to look for people in distress,
            and by the Post Officer to deliver mail. Some other uses of drones are:
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè Its visual spectrum sensors can survey and map land.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè Biological sensors can check air-quality read presence of speciifc micro-organisms.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè Its specific electromagnetic sensors can track geological information and help geophysicists identify the
            location of minerals, oil, and natural gas.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè It can survey pipelines, buildings, power lines, chimneys and roofs.
        </p>

        <h3>Robots</h3>
        <p>
            Like drones, robotics has become relatively inexpensive with expanding capabilities. <b>Robots</b> use
            cameras, microphones, and other sensors as inputs. Based on these inputs, robotic outputs can be as complex
            as exploring damaged nuclear reactors to as simple as taking a photo. Recent improvements in Robotics
            software and decrease in hardware prices have made robots more prevalent in industrial and hobbyist
            workshops. Robots can be found almost everywhere, including in a home vacuuming floors, in a factory
            assembling cars, on a farm sorting produce, and in hospitals assisting in surgery, see Figure 6-29. Like
            drones robotics have also done some notable achievements like RoboBee which can cling to the ceiling with
            static electricity, Tiny Origami Robots which unfolds in stomach and extract information from human body.
            EMILY is another remote-controlled robot lifeguard which has recently proved its worth by saving hundreds of
            Syrian refugees from drowning off the Greek island of Lesbos.
