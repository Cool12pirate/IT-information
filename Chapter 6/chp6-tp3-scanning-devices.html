        <h2>Scanning Devices</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Scanning Devices</b> convert scanned text and images into a form that the system unit can process. There
            are five types of scanning devices: optical scanners, card readers, bar code readers, RFID readers, and
            character and mark recoginition devices.
        </p>

        <h3>Optical Scanners</h3>
        <p>
            An <b>optical scanner,</b> also known as a <b>scanner</b>, accepts documents consisting of text and/or
            images and convert them to machine-readable form. These devices do not recognise individual letters or
            images. Typically, scanned documents are saved in files that can be further processed, displayed, printed,
            or stored for later use. There are four basic types of optical scanners: flatbed, documents, portable, and
            3D.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Flatbed scanner</b> is much like a copy machine. The image to be scanned is placed on a glass surface,
            and the scanner records the image.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Documents scanner</b> is similar to a flatbed scanner expect that it can quickly scan multipage
            documents. It automatically feeds one page of a document at a time through a scanning surface, see Figure
            6-7.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Portable scanner</b> is typically a handheld device that slides across the image, making direct
            contact.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>3D scanners</b> use lasers, cameras, or robotic arms to record the shape of an object. Like 2D
            scanners, most 3D scanners cannot recognise light, dark, and coloured areas, see Figure 6-8.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>CamScanner</b> is a mobile application which is used to scan the document directly from the camera of
            the mobile. It makes your mobile a portable scanner. CamScanner can crop and improve the picture and make
            the text easily readable. Turbo Scan, Scanner Pro and Prizmo are some free scanner apps available.
        </p>

        <p>
            Optical scanners are powerful tools for a wide variety of end users, including graphics and advertising
            professionals who scan images and combine them with text.
        </p>

        <h3>Card Readers</h3>
        <p>
            Nearly everyone uses a credit card, debit card, access (parking or building) card, and/or some types of
            identification card. These cards typically have the user's name, some type of identification number, and
            signature on the card. Additionally, encoded information is often stored on the card. <b>Card readers</b>
            interpret this encoded information. Although there are several different types, by far the most common is
            the <b>magnetic card reader</b>. The encoded information is stored on a thin magnetic strip located on the
            back of the card. When the card is swiped through the magnetic card reader, the information is read. Many
            credit cards, known as <b>chip cards</b>, include additional security in the form of a microchip embedded in
            the credit card. This chip contains encrypted data that makes it nearly impossible for criminals to forge a
            duplicate card. Some chips require that you insert the card into a specialised reader, while others only
            require that you hold the card near the reader.
        </p>

        <h3>Bar Code Readers</h3>
        <p>
            You are probably familiar with <b>bar code redaers</b> or <b>scanners</b> from grocery stories. These
            devices
            are either handheld <b>wand readers</b> or <b>platform scanners</b>. They contain photoelectric cells that
            scan
            or read product containers. There are a variety of different codes, including <b>UPC</b> and <b>MaxiCode</b>
            codes.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>UPCs (Universal Product Codes)</b> are widely used by retail stores to automate the processes to check
            out customers, to change product prices, and to maintain inventory records.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>MaxiCode</b> is widely used by the United Parcel Service (UPS) and others to automate the process of
            routing packages, tracking in-transit packages, and locate lost packages.
        </p>

        <p>
            Smartphones with the appropriate app can also scan codes, see Figure 6-9. For example, after scanning the
            bar code from a product you are thinking of buying, the app Price Check by Amazon will in-store and online
            price comparisons as well as provide other customer product reviews.
        </p>

        <h3>RFID Readers</h3>
        <p>
            <b>RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags</b> are tiny chips that can be embedded in almost everything.
            They can found in consumer products, driver's licenses, passports, and any number of other items, see Figure
            6-10. These chips contain electronically stored information that can be read using an <b>RFID reader</b>
            located several yards away. They are widely used to track and locate lost pets; to monitor production and
            update inventory; and to record prices, product descriptions, and locations of retail items.
        </p>

        <h3>Character and Mark Recoginition Devices</h3>
        <p>
            Character and mark recoginition devices are scanners that are able to recognise special characters and
            marks. They are specialty devices that are essential tools for certain applications. Three types are:
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Magnetic-Ink Character Recoginition (MICR)</b> are used by banks to automatically read those unusal
            numbers on the bottom of cheques and deposit slips. A special-purpose machine known as a reader/sorter reads
            these numbers and provide input that allow banks to efficiently maintain customer account balances.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Optical Character Recoginition (OCR)</b> uses special preprinted characters that can be read by a light
            source and changed handheld wand reader, see Figure 6-11. These are used in department stores to read retail
            price tags by reflecting light on printed characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Optical-Mark Recoginition (OMR)</b> senses the presence or absence of a mark, such as a pencil mark.
            OMR is often used to score standardised multiple-choice tests.
