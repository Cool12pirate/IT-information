        <h2>Printers</h2>
        <p>
            Even as many individuals, schools, and businesses are trying to go paperless, printers remain one of the
            most used output devices. You probably use a printer to print homework assignments, photographs, and web
            pages. Printers translate information that has been processed by the system unit to the information on
            paper. Printer output is often called <b>hard copy</b>.
        </p>

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>
            There are many different types of printers. Almost all, however, have some basic distinguishing features,
            including resolution, colour capability, speed memory, and duplex printing.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Resolution</b> for a printer is similar to monitor resolution. It is a measure of the clarity of images
            produced. Printer resolution, however, is measured in <b>dpi (dots per inch)</b>, see Figure 6-21. Most
            printers designed for personal use average 1,200 by 4,800 dpi. The higher the dpi, the better the quality of
            images produced.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Colour capability</b> is provided by most printers today. Users typically have the option to print
            either with just black in or with colour. Because it is more expensive to print in colour, most users select
            black ink for letters, drafts, and homework. The most common black ink selection in <b>grayscale</b>, in
            which images are displayed using many shades of gray. Colour is used more selectively for final reports
            containing graphics and for photographs.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Speed</b> is measured in the number of pages printed per minute. Typically, printers for personal use
            average 15 to 19 pages per minute for single-colour (Black) output and 13 to 15 pages per minute for colour
            output.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Memory</b> within a printer is used to store printing instructions and documents waiting to be printed.
            The more memory, the faster it will be able to print large documents.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Duplex printing</b> allows automatic printing on both sides of a sheet of paper. Although not currently
            a standard feature for all printers, it will likely become standard in the future as a way to reduce paper
            waste and to protect the environment
        </p>

        <p class="envo-b">
            <span class="envo-h">Environment üå¥</span> <br>
            Have you considered the environment impact of using your inkjet printer? Whenever possible, don't print. Use
            e-mail attachments, and encourage your school to use web technologies that let students upload thier
            schoolwork. If you must print, buy ink cartridges that are made with mostly recycled plastic. And when your
            ink runs out, bring the cartridge to retailer that will make sure it is recycled. Many retailers often offer
            a discount on a new cartridge when you supply an empty one.
        </p>

        <h3>Inkjet Printers</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Inkjet Printers</b> spary ink at high speed onto the surface of paper. This process produces high-quality
            images in a variety of colours, making it deal for printing photos, see Figure 6-22. Inkjet printers are
            relatively inexpensive and are the most widely used printers. In addition, they are reliable and quiet. The
            most costly aspect of inkjet printers is replacing the ink cartridges. For this reason, most users specify
            black ink for the majority of print jobs and use the more expensive colour printing for select applications.
            Typical inkjet printers produce 15 to 19 pages per minute of black-only output and 13 and 15 pages of colour
            output.
        </p>

        <h3>Laser Printers</h3>
        <p>
            The <b>Laser printers</b> uses a technology similar to that used in a photocopying machine. Laser printers
            use a laser light beam to produce images with excellent letter and graphics quality. More expensive than
            inkjet printers, laser printers are faster and are used in applications requiring high-quality output. There
            are two categories of laser printers. <b>Personal laser printers</b> are less expensive and are used by a
            sigle user. They typically can print 15 to 17 pages a minute. <b>Shared laser printers</b> typically support
            colour, are more expensive typically support colour, are more expensive, and are used (shared) by a group of
            users. Shared laser printers typically print over 50 pages a minute.
        </p>

        <h3>3D Printers</h3>
        <p>
            <b>3D printers</b>, also known as <b>additive manufracturing</b>, create three-dimensional shapes by adding
            very thin layer after of material until the final shape is fully formed, see Figure 6-23. There are a
            variety of different processes and materials that can be used to create each layer. One of the most common
            3D printer sprays a liquid plastic or plastic like substance through a nozzle similar to an inkjet printer.
            3D printers are controlled by data describing the shape of the object to be created. This data typically
            comes from a file created by a 3D modeling program or from scanning a physical model using a 3D scanner.
            Specilaised programs that take this data and further process it to create data describing hundreds or
            thousands of horizontal layers that when placed one on top of another form the shape of the intended object.
            The printer uses this data by extruding or cutting the first layer to very exact specifications. Successive
            layers are then created and attached to the layer below it until the product is finalised. The layers are so
            thin and so precise that they blend together, making a final product that shows no sign of the individual
            layers.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Printers</h3>
        <p>
            There are several types of printers. These printers include cloud printers, thermal printers, and plotters:
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Cloud printers</b> are printers connected to the Internet that provide printing services to others on
            the Internet. <b>Google Cloud Print</b> is a service that supports cloud printing. Once a user activates a
            printer using the Google Chrome OS, the user can access the printers anywhere with a smartphone or any other
            type of computer that is connected to the Internet. For example, you could use a smartphone from almost
            anywhere to send documents to be printed on a printer located at your home or school.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Thermal Printers</b> use heat elements to produce images on heat-sensitive paper. These printers are
            widely used with ATMs and gasoline pumps to print receipts, see Figure 6-24.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Plotters</b> are special-purpose printers for producing a wide range of specialised output. Using
            output from graphics tablets and other input devices, plotters create maps, images, and architectural and
            engineers, and architectural and engineering drawings. Plotters are typically used by graphic artists,
            engineers, and architects to print out designs, sketches and drawings.

        <p class="thi-b">
            <span class="thi-h">Think About It</span> <br>
            You might have seen colour printers and color printouts. What is your opinion are the advantages of color
            printouts over black and white printouts?
