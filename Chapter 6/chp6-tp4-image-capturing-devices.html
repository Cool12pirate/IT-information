        <h2>Image Capturing Devices</h2>
        <p>
            Optical scanners, like traditional copy machines, can make a copy from an original. For example, an optical
            scanner can make a digital copy of a photograph. <em>Image capturing devices</em>, on the other hand, create
            and capture original images. There devices include digital cameras and webcams.
        </p>

        <p class="ethics-b" id="digitalcam">
            <span class="ethics-h">Ethics</span> <br>
            You have heard of instances where webcams were used to broadcast the activities of individuals who did not
            know they were being recorded. For example, in some cases public webcams have recorded embarrassing footage
            of people who were not aware of the camera. It has been argued that capturing and then broadcasting a
            person's video without his or her knowledge and consent is unethical. What do you think?
        </p>

        <h3>Digital Cameras</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Digital cameras</b> capture images digitally and store the images on a memory card or in the camera's
            memory.
            Most digital cameras are also able to record video as well, see Figure 6-12. Almost all tablets and
            smartphones
            have built-in digital cameras capable of taking images and video. You can take a picture, view it
            immediately,
            and even place it on your own page, within minutes.

        <h3>Webcams</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Webcams</b> are specialised digital video cameras that capture images and send them to a computer for
            broadcast over the Internet. Webcams are built into most smartphones and tablets. Desktop and laptop webcams
            are either built in or attached to the computer's monitor, see Figure 6-13.
