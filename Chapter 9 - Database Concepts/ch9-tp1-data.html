        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>
            Like a library, secondary storage is designed to store information. How is this stored information
            organised? What are databases, and why do you need to know anything about them? Only a few decades ago, a
            computer was considered to be an island with only limited access to information beyond its own hard disk.
            Now, through communication networks and the Internet, individual computers have direct electronic access to
            almost unlimited sources of information. Information systems consist of people, procedures, software,
            hardware, data, and the Internet. This page focus on <b>data</b>, which can be defined as facts or
            observations about people, places, things, and events. More specifically, this page focuses on how databases
            store, organise, and use data.
        </p>


        <p>
            Not long ago, data was limited to numbers, letters, and symbols recorded by keyboards. Now, data is much
            richer and includes:
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè Audio captured, interpreted, and saved using microphones and voice recognition systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè Music downloaded from the Internet and saved on smartphones, tablets, and other devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè Photographs captured by digital cameras, edited by image editing software, and shared with others over the
            internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè Video captured by digital video cameras, TV tuner cards, and webcams.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two ways or perspectives to view data. There perspective are the <em>physical view</em> and the
            <em>logical view</em>. The <b>physical view</b> focuses on the actual format and location of the data. As
            discussed in ....., data is recorded as digital bits that are typically grouped together into bytes the
            represent characters using a coding scheme such as Unicode. Typically, only very specialised computer
            professionals are concerned with the physical view. The other perspective, the <b>logical view</b>, focuses
            on the meaning, content, and context of the data. End users and most computer professionals are concerned
            with this view. They are involved with actually using the data with application programs. This page presents
            the logical view of data and how data is stored in databases.
