        <h2>Data Organisation</h2>
        <p>
            The first step in understanding databases is to learn how data is organised. In the logical view, data is
            organised. In the logical view, data is organised into groups or categories. Each group is more complex than
            the one before. This is explained through Figure 9-1.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Character</b>: A <b>character</b> is the most basic logical data element. It is a single letter,
            number, or special character, such as a punctuation mark, or a symbol, such as ‚Çπ.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Field</b>: The next higher level is a <b>field</b> or group of related characters. In our example,
            Masurkar is in the data field for the Last Name of an employee. It consists of the individuals letters
            (characters) that make up the last name. A data field represents an <b>attribute</b> (description or
            characters) of some <b>entity</b> (person, place, thing, or object). For example, an employee is an entity
            with many attributes, including his or her last name.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Record</b>: A <b>record</b> is a collection of related fields. It represents a collection of attributes
            that describe an entity. In our example, payroll record for an employee consists of data fields describing
            the attributes for one employee. These attributes are First Name, Last Name, Employee ID, and Salary.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Table</b>: A <b>table</b> is a collection of related records. For example, the Payroll Table would
            include payroll information (records) for the employees (entitites).
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Database</b>: A <b>database</b> is an integrated collection of logically related employee tables
            including the Payroll Table and the Benefits Table.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Fields</h3>
        <p>
            Each record in a table has at least one distinctive field, called the <b>key field</b>. Also known as the
            <b>primary key</b>, this field uniquely identifies the record. Tables can be related or connected to other
            tables by common key fields. For most employee databases, a key field is an employee identification number.
            Key fields in different tables can be used to integrate the data in a database. For example, in the
            Personnel Database, both the Payroll and the Benefits tables include the field Employee ID. Data from the
            two tables could be related by combining all records with the same key field (employee ID).
        </p>

        <h3>Batch versus Real-Time Processing</h3>
        <p>
            Traditionally, data is processed in one of the two ways. These are batch processing, or what we might call
            "later," and real-time processing, or what we might call "now." These two methods have been used to handle
            common record-keeping activities such as payroll and sales orders.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Batch processing</b>: In batch processing data is collected over several hours, days, or even weeks. It
            is then processed all at once as a "batch." If you have a credit card, your bill probably reflects batch
            processing. That is, during the month, you buy things charge them to your credit card. Each time you charge
            something, an electronic copy of the transaction is sent to the credit card company. At some point in the
            month, the company's data processing department puts all those transactions (and those of many other
            customers) together and processes them at one time. The company then sends you a single bill totalling the
            amount you owe, see Figure 9-2.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Real-time processing</b>: Real-time processing, also known as <b>online processing</b>, occurs when
            data is processed at the same time the transaction occurs. For example, whenever you request funds at an
            ATM, real-time processing occurs. After you have provided account information and requested a specific
            withdrawal, the bank's computer verifies that you have sufficient funds in your account. If you do, then the
            funds are dispensed to you, and the bank immediately updates the balance of your account, see Figure 9-3.
        </p>

            <span class="con-h">Concept Check</span> <br>
            <b>1.</b> From the logical view, describe how data is organised or categorised. <br>
            <b>2.</b> What are key fields and how are they used? <br>
            <b>3.</b> Compare batch processing and real-time processing.
