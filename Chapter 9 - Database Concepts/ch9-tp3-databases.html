        <h2>Databases</h2>
        <p>
            Many organisations have multiple files on the same subject or person. For example, a customer's name and
            address could appear in different files within the sales department, biling department, and credit
            department. This is called data redundancy. If the customer moves, then the address in each file must be
            updated. If one or more files are overlooked, problems are likely to arise. For example, a product ordered
            might be sent to the new address, but the bill might be sent to the old address. This situation results from
            a lack of <b>data integrity</b>. Moreover, data spread around in different files is not as useful. The
            marketing department, for instance might want to offer special promotions to customers who order large
            quantities of merchandise. To identify these customers, the marketing department would need to obtain
            permission and access to files in the biling department. It would be much more efficient if all data were in
            a common database. A database can make the needed information available.
        </p>

        <h3>Need for Databases</h3>
        <p>
            For an organisation, there are many advantages to having databases:
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Sharing</b>: In organisations, information from one department can be readily shared with others.
            Billing could let the marketing department know which customers ordered large quantities of merchandise.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Security:</b> Users are given passwords or access only to the kind of information they need. Thus, the
            payroll department may have access to employees' pay rates, but other departments would not.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Less data redundancy:</b> Without a common database, individual departments have to create and maintain
            thier own data, and data redundancy results. For example, an employee's home address would likely appear in
            several files. Redundant data causes inefficient use of storage space and data maintenance problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Data integrity:</b> When there are multiple sources of data, each source may have variations. A
            customer's address may be listed as "Main Street" in one system and "Main St." in another. With
            discrepancies like these, it is probable that the customer would be treated as two separate people.
        </p>

        <h3>Database Management</h3>
        <p>
            In order to create, modify, and gain access to a database, special software is required. This software is
            called a <b>Database Management System,</b> which is commonly abbreviated as <b>DBMS</b>. <br>
            Some DBMSs, such as Microsoft Access, are designed specifically for personal computers. Other DBMSs are
            designed for specialised database servers. DBMS software is made up of five parts or subsystems: <em>DBMS
                engine, data manipulation, application generation,</em> and <em>data administration.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè The <b>DBMS engine</b> provides a bridge between the logical view of the data and the physical view of the
            data. When users request (logical perspective), the DBMS engine handles the details of actually locating the
            data (physical perspective).
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè The <b>data definition subsystem</b> defines the logical structure of the database by using a <b>data
                dictionary</b> or <b>schema.</b> This dictionary contains a description of the structure of data in
            database. For a particular item of data, it defines the names used for a particular field. It defines the
            type of data for each field (text, numeric, time, graphic, audio, and video). An example of an Access data
            dictionary form is presented in Figure 9-4.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè The <b>data manipulation subsystem</b> provides tools for maintaining and analysing data. Maintaining data
            is known as <b>data maintenance</b>. It involves adding new data, deleting old data, and editing existing
            data. Analysis tool support viewing all or selected parts of the data, querying the database, and generating
            reports. Specific tools include <b>query-by-example</b> and a specialised programming language called
            <b>Structured Query Language (SQL)</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè The <b>application generation subsystem</b> provides tools to create data entry forms and specialised
            programming languages that interface or work with common and widely used programming languages such as C++
            or Visual Basic. See Figure 9-5 for a data entry form created by the application generation subsystem in
            Access.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè The <b>data administration subsystem</b> helps to manage the overall database, including maintaining
            security, providing disaster recovery support, and monitoring the overall performance of database
            operations. Larger organisations typically employ highly trained computer specialists, called <b>Database
                Administration (DBAs)</b>, to interact with the data administration subsystem. Additional duties of
            database administrations include determining <b>processing rights</b> or determining which people have
            access to what kinds of data in the database.
