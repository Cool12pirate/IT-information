        <h2>Types of Databases</h2>
        <p>
            Databases may be small or large, limited in accessibility or widely accessible. Database may be classified
            into four types: individual, company, distributed, and commercial.
        </p>

        <h3>Individual</h3>
        <p>
            The <b>individual database</b> is also called a <b>personal computer database.</b> It is a collection of
            integrated files primarily used by just one person. Typically, the data and the DBMS are under the direct
            control of the user. They are stored either on the user's hard-disk drive or on a LAN file server. There may
            be many times in your life when you will find this kind of database valuable. If you are in sales, for
            instance, a personal computer database can be used to keep track of your customers. If you are a sales
            manager, you can keep track of your salespeople and thier performance. If you are advertising account
            executive, you can keep track of your different projects and how many hours to charge each client.
        </p>

        <h3>Comapny</h3>
        <p>
            Companie, of course create databases for thier own use. The <b>company database</b> may be stored on a
            central database server and managed by a database administrator. Users throughout the company have access to
            the database through thier personal computers linked to local or wide are networks. Company databases are
            the foundation for management information systems. For instance, a department store can record all sales
            transaction in the database. A sales manager can use this information to see salespeople are selling the
            most products. The manager can then determine year-end sales bounses. Or the store's buyer can learn which
            products are selling well or not selling make adjustments when reordering. A top executive might combine
            overall store sales trends with information from outside databases about consumer and population trends.
            This information could be used to change the whole merchandising strategy of the store.
        </p>

        <h3>Distributed</h3>
        <p>
            Many times the data in a company is stored not in just one location but in several locations. It is made
            accessible through a variety of communications networks. The database, then, is a distributed database. That
            is, not all the data in a database is physically located in one place. Typically, database servers on a
            client/server network provide the link between the data. For instance, some database information can be at
            regional offices. Some can be at company headquarters, some down the hall from you, and some even overseas.
            Sales figures for a chain of department stores, then, could be located at the various stores. But executives
            at district offices or at the chain's headquarters could have access to all these figures.
        </p>

        <h3>Commercial</h3>
        <p>
            A <b>commercial database</b> is generally an enormous database than an organisation develops to cover a
            particular subjects. It offers access to this database to the public or selected outside individuals for a
            fee. Sometimes commercial databases also are called <b>information utilities</b> or <b>data banks</b>. An
            example is NSE Infobase, which offers a variety of information-gathering and reporting services, see Figure
            9-11.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of the most widely used commercial databases are:
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Dialog Information Services </b> offers business information, as well as technical and scientific
            information.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Dow Jones Interactive Publishing </b> provides world news and information on business, investments, and
            stocks.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>NSE Infobase</b> offers news and information on legal news, public records, and business issues.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of the commercial database are designed for organisational as well as individual use. Organisations
            typically, pay a membership fee plus hourly use fees. Often, individuals are able to search the database to
            obtain a summary of available information without charge. They pay only for those items selected for further
            investigation. Refer Table 9-2 for a summary of the four types of databases.
