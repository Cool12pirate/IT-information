        <h2>DBMS structure</h2>
        <p>
            DBMS programs are designed to work with data that is logically structured or arranged in a particular way.
            This arrangement is known as the <b>database model.</b> These models define rules and standards for all the
            data in a database. For example, Microsoft Access is designed to work with databases using the relational
            data model. Five common database models are <em>hierarchical, network, relational, multidimensional,</em>
            and <em>object-oriented.</em>
        </p>

        <h3>Hierarchical Database</h3>
        <p>
            At one time, nearly every DBMS designed for mainframes used the hierarchical data model. In a
            <b>hierarchical database,</b> fields or records and structured in nodes. <b>Nodes</b> are points connected
            like the branches of an upside-down tree. Each entry has one <b>parent node,</b> although a parent may have
            several <b>child nodes</b>. This sometimes described as a <b>one-to-many relationship.</b> To find a
            particular field, you have to start at the top with a parent and trace down the tree to a child. The nodes
            farther down the system are subordinate to the ones above, like the hierarchy of managers in a corporation.
            An example of a hierarchical database is a system to organise music files, see Figure 9-6. The parent node
            is the music library for a particular user. This parent has four children, labeled "artist." Coldplay, one
            of the children, has three children, labeled "song."
        </p>
        <p>
            The problems with a hierarchical database is that if one parent node is deleted, so are all the subordinate
            child nodes. Moreover, a child node cannot be added unless a parent node is added first. The most
            significant limitation is the rigid structure: one parent only per child, and no relationships or
            connections between child nodes themselves.
        </p>

        <h3>Network Database</h3>
        <p>
            Responding to the limitations of the hierarchical data model, network were developed. A <b>network
                database</b> also had a hierarchical arrangement of nodes. However, each child node may have more than
            one parent node. This is sometimes described as a <b>many-to-many relationship</b>. There are additional
            connections-called <b>pointers</b>- between parent nodes and child nodes. Thus, a node may be reached
            through more than one path. It may be traced down through different branches. For example, a university
            could use this type of organisation, you can see that each student can have more than one teacher. Each
            teacher also can teach more than one course. Students may take more than a single course. This demonstrates
            how the network arrangement is more flexible and in many cases more efficient than the hierarchical
            arrangement.
        </p>

        <h3>Relational Database</h3>
        <p>
            A more flexible type of organisation is the <b>realtional database</b>. In this structure, there are no
            access paths down a hierarchy. Rather, the data elements are stored in different tables, each of which
            consits of rows and columns. A table and its data are called a <b>relation.</b> An example of a relational
            database is shown in Figure 9-8. This Vehicle Owner Table contains license numbers, names, and addresses for
            all registered drivers. Within the table, a row is a record containing information about one driver. Each
            column is a field. The fields are License Number, Last Name, First Name, Street, City, State, and Zip. All
            related tables must have a <b>common data item</b> enabling information stored in one table to be linked
            with information stored in another. In this case, the three tables are related by the License Number field.
        </p>

        <p>
            Police officers who stop a speeding car look up the driver's information in the Department of Motor Vehicles
            database, Figure 9-9 using the driver's license number. They also can check for any unpaid traffic
            violations in the Outstanding Citations Table. Finally, if the officers suspect that the car is stolen, they
            can look up what vehicles the driver owns in the Vehicle Table. The most valuable feature of relational
            databases is thier simplicity. Entries can be easily added, deleted, and modified. The hierarchical and
            network databases are more rigid. The relational organisation is common for personal computer DBMSs such as
            Access. Relational databases are also widely used for mainframe and midrange systems.
        </p>

        <h3>Multidimensional Database</h3>
        <p>
            The multidimensional data model is a variation and an extension of the relational data model. Whereas
            relational databases use tables conisting of rows and colums, <b>multidimensional databases</b> extend this
            two-diemensional data model to include additional or multiple dimensions, sometimes called a <b>data
                cube.</b> Data can be viewed as a cube having three or more sides and consisting of cells. Each side of
            the cube is considered a dimension of the data. In this way, complex relationships between data can be
            represented and efficiently analysed. Multidimensional databases provide several advantages over relational
            databases. Two of the most significant advanatges are:
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Conceptualisation:</b> Multidimensional databases and data cubes provide users with an intuitive model
            in which complex data and relationships can be conceptualised.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Processing Speed:</b> Analysing and querying a large multidimensional database can be much faster. For
            example, a query requiring just a few seconds on a multidimensional database could take minutes or hours to
            perform on a relational database.
        </p>

        <h3>Object-Oriented Database</h3>
        <p>
            The other data structure are primarily designed to handle structured data such as names, addresses, pay
            rates, and so on. <b>Object-oriented database</b> are more flexible and store data as well as instructions
            to manipulate the data. Additionally, this structure is ideally designed to provide input for
            object-oriented software development. Object-oriented data using classes, objects, attributes, and methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Classes</b> are general definitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Objects</b> are specific instances of a class that can contain both data and instructions to manipulate
            the data.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Attributes</b> are the data fields an object possesses.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Methods</b> are instructions for retrieving or manipulating attribute values.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, a health club might use an object-oriented employment database, see Figure 9-10. The database
            uses a class, Employee, to define employee objects that are stored in the database. This definition includes
            the attributes First Name, Last Name, Address, and Wage and the method Pay. Atul, Neha, and Aparna are
            objects each with specific attributes value. For example, the object Atul has the stored value Atul, 191,
            Pitampura, 110034. Although hierarchical and network databases are still widely used, the relational,
            multidimensional, and object-oriented data models are more popular today. For summary of DBMS organisation,
            refer Table 9-1.
