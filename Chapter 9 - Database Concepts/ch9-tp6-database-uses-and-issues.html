        <h2>Database Uses and Issues</h2>
        <p>
            Databases offer great opportunities for productivity. In fact, in corporate libraries, electronic databases
            are now considered more valuable than books and journals. However, maintaining databases means users must
            make constant efforts to keep them from being tampered with or misused.
        </p>

        <h3>Strategic Uses</h3>
        <p>
            Databases help users to keep up to date and to keep up to date and to plan for the future. To support the
            needs of managers and other business professionals, many organisations collect data from a variety of
            internal and ecternal databases. This data is then stored in a special type of database called a <b>data
                warehouse</b>. A technique called <b>data mining</b> is often used to search these databases to look for
            related information and patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are hundreds of databases available to help users with both general and specific business purposes,
            including:
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <em>Business directories</em> providing addresses, financial and marketing information, products, and
            trade and brand names.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <em>Demographic data</em>, such as country and city statistics, current estimates on population and
            income, employment statistics, census data, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <em>Business statistical information</em>, such as financial information on publicly traded companies,
            market potential of certain retail stores, and other business data and information.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <em>Text databases</em> providing articles from business publications, press releases, reviews on
            companies and products, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <em>Web databases</em> covering a wide range of topics, including all of the above. As mentioned earlier,
            web seravh sites like Google maintain extensive databases of available Internet content.
        </p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
            Precisely because databases are so valuable, thier security has become a critical issue. One concern is that
            personal and private information about people stored in databases may be used for the wrong purposes. For
            instance, a person's credit history or medical records might be used to make hiring promotion decisions.
            Another concern is unauthorised users gaining access to a database. For example, there have been numerous
            instances in which a computer virus has been launched into a database or network.
        </p>

        <p>
            Security may require putting guards in company computer rooms and checking the identification of everyone
            admitted. Some security systems electronically check fingerprints, see Figure 9-12. Security is particularly
            important to organisations using WANs. Violations can occur without actually entering secured areas. As
            mentioned in previous pages, most major corporations today use special hardware amd software called
            firewalls to control access to thier internal networks.
