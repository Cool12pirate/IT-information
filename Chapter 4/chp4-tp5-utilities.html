        <h2>Utilities</h2>
        <p>
            Idealy, personal computers would continuosly run without problems. However, that simply is not the case. All
            kinds of things can happens-internal hard disks can crash, computers can freeze up, operations can slow
            down, and so on. This events can make computing very frustrating. That's where utilities come in.
            <b>Utilities</b> are specialised programs designed to make computing easier. There are hundreds of different
            utility programs. The most essential are :-
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Troubleshooting</b> or <b>diagnostic programs</b> that recoginse and correct problems, ideally before
            they become serious.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Antivirus programs</b> that gaurd your computer system viruses or other damaging programs that can
            invade your computer system. Popular antivirus programs include Norton Antivirus, AVG Antivirus and Webroot
            Secure Anywhere Antivirus.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Backup Programs</b> that make copies of files to be used in case the originals are lost or damaged.
            Windows 10 comes with a free backup program, the File History tool, and macOS X has a backup feature named
            Time Machine.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>File compression programs</b> that reduce the size of files so they require less storage space and can
            be sent more efficiently over the Internet. Most operating systems handle unzipping files automatically when
            you open a .zip file.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Virtual assistants</b> are utilities that accept commands through text or speech to allow intuitive
            interaction with your computer, smartphone, or tablet and coordinate personal data across multiple
            applications. Microsoft Windows 10 introduction with virtual assistant <b>Cortana</b> in 2015, and Apple's
            virtual assistant, <b>Siri</b>, started as a mobile operating system utility for iOS before being brought to
            desktop with macOS Yosemite in 2016.
        </p>

        <p id="win-uti">
            Most operating systems provide some utility programs. Even more powerful utility programs can be purchased
            separately or in utility suites.
        </p>

        <h3> Windows Utilities</h3>
        <p>
            The Windows operating systems are accompained by several utility programs, including File History, Disk
            Cleanup, and Optimise Drives. Here we discussed two utility programs.
        </p>

            Have you ever experienced problems after installing a new program or changing system settings? If so, the
            System Restore Utility can help by reversing the changes and bringing your computer to a previous point in
            time. For Windows 10: <br>
            <b>1.</b> Go to Windows 10 start screen and then type "recovery" in the search bar. <br>
            <b>2.</b> Click on <em>Open System Restore</em> from the Advanced recovery tools list. <br>

            contacts, and favorties and on the desktop. It helps protect you from the effects of a disk faliure. For
            example, you can select <em>File History</em> from the Windows 10 System and Security window to create a
            backup for your hard disk as shown in Figure 4-11.

            When you surf the web, a variety of programs and files are saved on your hard disk. Many of these and other
            files are not essential. <b>Disk Cleanup</b> is troubleshooting utility that identifies and eliminates
            nonessential files. This free up valuable disk space and improves system performance. For example, by
            opening Disk Cleanup from the search results, you can eliminate unneeded files on your hard disk as shown in
            Figure 4-12.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Steps :-</b>1. Click the Windows icon in the lower left of the screen, type "disk cleanup," and select
            <em>Disk Cleanup.</em> <br>
            2. Review the files suggested for cleanup, and then click <em>OK.</em> <br>
            3. Confirm that you want to permanently delete these files by clicking <em>Delete Files.</em> <br>
            4. The utility cleans the selected files.

            As you use your computer, your hard disk with fill with photos, videos, documents, and applications. You may
            find that as you run out of hard drive space, your computer slows down. Most operating systems include
            utilities to organise and view you hard drive usage to identify old or unused files. Using these tools, you
            can move or eliminate files and give your operating system the space it needs to run at peak efficiency. For
            example, <b>Storage</b> is a utility program included with Windows 10 that eliminates unused files and
            applications as shown in Figure 4-13.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Steps :-</b> <br>
            1. Click the Windows icon in the lower left of the screen, type "storage" and select storage. <br>
            2. Review the local storage attached to your computer and use the bar chart to tell which drives are almost
            full. <br>
            3. Review the storage usage for this PC. The report identifies different types of files on the storage
            devices and the bar charts indicate how much of the used space each type of file take up on the hard drive.
            <br>
            4. Apps and features. <br>
            5. Browse the installed apps and games to find unnecessary files. <br>
            6. Click on an application you want to remove and click uninstall to remove it.

        <h3>Utility Suites</h3>
        <p>
            Like application software suites, <b>utility suites</b> combine several programs into one package. Buying
            the package is less expensive than buying the programs separately. Some of the best-known utility suites are
            BitDefender and Norton, see Figure 4-14. These suites provide a variety of utilities. Some programs improve
            hard disk efficiency, while other programs will protect your system from dangerous computer <b>viruses</b>.
            You can "catch" a computer virus in many ways, including by opening attachments to e-mails messages and
            downloading software from the Internet.
