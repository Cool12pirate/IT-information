        <p class="start-p1">Someday soon, your computer will be able to automatically diagnose and repair problems on
            its own, much like your body's immune system. For now, however, your electronics are at risk from dangerous
            viruses and software failures. <br>
            ‚Üí This Page covers the things you need to know to protect your computer and data today and to prepare you
            for
            tomorrow, including:</p>

            ‚ñ∂ Kunal has just completed his formal education and now wants to join some professional training programs.
            He finds his interest in gadgets and computer devices. He does not want to restrict his learning to hardware
            or software only. His teacher guides him to learn system software and tells him to learn system software
            coordinates the actions and tasks of hardware and software, and also controls the operations of computer
            hardware. The idea of learning System Software strickes Kunal and he is now ready to take his career forward
            in this domain. <br>
            This page introduce Operating System which is the backbone of the computing system.

        <p class="start-p4">
            End users use application software to accomplish specific tasks. For example, we use word processing
            programs to create letters, documents, and reports. However, end users also use system software. <b>System
                software</b> works with end users, application software, and computer hardware to handle the majority of
            technical details. For example, system software controls where a word processing program is stored in
            memory, how commands, are converted so that the system unit can process them, and where a completed
            documents or file is saved. <br>

            System software is not a single program. Rather, it is a collection or a system of programs that handle
            hundreds of technical details with little or no user intervention. System software consists of four types of
            programs.
