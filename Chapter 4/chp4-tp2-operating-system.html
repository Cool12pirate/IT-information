        <h2>Operating System</h2>
        <p>
            An <b>operating system</b> is a collection of programs that handle many of the technical details related to
            use of a computer. In many ways, an operating system is the most important type of computer program. Without
            a functionin operating system, your computer would be useless.
        </p>

        <img src="operating system.png" alt="operating-system" width="60%" id="functions">

        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>
            Every computer has an operating system, and every operating system performs a variety of functions. These
            functions can be classified into three groups:
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Managing resources:</b> Operating system coordinate all the resources of a computer, including memory,
            processing storage, and devices such as printers and monitors. They also monitor system performance,
            schedule tasks, provide security, and start up the computer.
        </p>



        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Providing user interface:</b> Operating systems allow user to interact with application programs and
            computer hardware through a <b>user Interface</b>. Originally, operating systems used
            a character-based interface in which users communicated with the operating system through written commands
            such as "Copy A: report.txt C:'. Today most operating systems use a <b><a id="links"
                    href="www.google.com">Graphical User Interface (GUI)</a></b>. A GUI uses graphical elements such as
            icons and windows. A new feature available with many operating systems is voice recoginition. This allow
            users to interact with voice commands.

        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Running applications</b> Operating systems load and run application such as word processors and
            spreadsheets. Most operating systems support multitasking, or ability to switch between different
            application stored in memory. With <b>multitasking</b>, you could have Word and Excel running at the same
            time and switch easily between the two applications. The program that you are currently working on is
            described as running in the <b>foreground</b>. The other program or programs are running in the
            <b>background</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="ethics-b" id="features">
            <span class="ethics-h">Ethics</span> <br>
            Many operating systems now include voice assistance tools so that you can ask your computer simple questions
            without using a keyboard or mouse. For the voice assistance tools to recognise a question directed to it,
            its microphone should always remain switched on and a computer always analysing conversations. What many do
            not realise is that these devices are always listening and recording conversations. Further, to improve
            voice recoginition, these computers compile user assistance tool to the user. Could such data be used
            unethically? Who should oversee this data, and what limits should be placed on its use?


        </p>

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>
            Starting or restarting a computer is called <b>booting</b> the system. There are two ways to boot a
            computer: a warm boot and a cold boot. A <b>warm boot</b> occurs when the computer is already on and you
            restart it withour turning off the power. A Warm boot can be accomplished in several ways. For many computer
            systems, they can be restarted by simply pressing a sequence of keys. Starting a computer that has been
            turned off is called a <b>cold boot.</b> You typically interact with the operating system through the
            graphical user interface. For doing this, operating systems provide a plcae, called the <b>desktop,</b> that
            provide access to computer resources see Figure 4-2. Some important features common to most operating
            systems and applicatio programs include:
        </p>

        <p>
            <b><a id="links" href="ww.">Icons</a>:</b> Graphics representation for a program, type of file, or function.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><a id="links" href="f">Pointer</a>:</b> Controlled by a mouse and changes shape depending upon its
            current function. For example, when shaped like an arrow, the pointer can be used to select items such as an
            icon.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><a id="links" href="F">Windows</a>:</b> Rectangular areas for displaying information and running
            programs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><a id="links" href="k">Menus</a>:</b> Provide a list of options or commands that can be selected.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><a href="h" id="links">Tabs</a>:</b> Divide menus into major activity areas such as format and page
            layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><a href="h" id="links">Dialog boxes</a>:</b> Typically provide information or request input.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><a href="h" id="links">Help</a>:</b> Provides online assistance for operating system functions and
            procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><a href="h" id="links">Gesture controls</a>:</b> Gesture control feature controls touch and look features
            on touch enabled and look features on touch enabled devices.
        </p>


        <p id="categories">
            Most offices have filing cabinets that store important documents in folders. Similarly, most operating
            systems store data and programs in a system of files and folders. <b>Files</b> are used to store data and
            programs. Related files are stored within a <b>folder</b>, and, for organisational purposes, a folder can
            contain other folders, or subfolders. For example, yuo might organise your electronic files in the
            <em>Documents</em> folder on your hard disk. This folder could contain other folders, each named to indicate
            its contents. One might be 'Computer Class' and could contain all the files you have created (or will
            create) for this course.
        </p>

        <h3>Categories</h3>
        <p>
            While there are hundreds of different systems, there are only three basic categories: embedded, stand-alone,
            and network.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Embedded operating systems,</b> also known as <b><a id="links" href="f">Real-Time Operating System
                    (RTOS)</a></b>, are entirely stored within (i.e., embedded ) a device. They control smartwatches,
            smartphones, video game systems, and thousands of other small electronic devices. Typically designed for a
            specific application, embedded operating systems are essential in the evolution of Internet of Things (IoT)
            where many everyday devices are able to communicate with one another. For example, Watch OS was developed by
            Apple exclusively for the Apple Watch and Pebble OS was developed by Pebble Technology specifically for the
            Pebble Smartwatches, see Figure 4-3. Blink Smartwatches created by Banglore-based Witworks uses its own
            Marvin OS, which is based on Android and Intex's iRist smartwatch uses Android KitKat, not Android Wear
            (Google's OS for Wearables).
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Stand-alone operating systems,</b> also called <b>desktop operating systems</b>, control a single
            desktop or laptop computer. (See Figure 4-4.) These operating systems are located on the computer's hard
            disk. Often desktop computers and laptop are part of a network. In these case, the desktop operating system
            works wiht the network to share and coordinate resources.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b><a id="links" href="f">Network Operating System (NOS)</a></b> are used to control and coordinate
            computers that are networked linked together. Many networks are small and connect only a limited number of
            personal computers. Other networks, like those at colleges and universiies, are very large and complex.
            These networks may include other smaller networks and typically connect a variety of different types of
            computers. Network operating systems are typically located on one of the connected computers' hard disks.
            Called the <b>network server,</b> this computer coordinates all communication between the other computers.
            Popular network operating systems include Linux, Windows Server, and UNIX.
        </p>


        <p class="envo-b">
            <span class="envo-h">Environment üå¥</span> <br>
            Did you know that some operating systems help protect the environment? Recent versions of Microsoft Windows
            operating system have various power management features that reduce energy consumption. For example, Windows
            will dim your screen and put your computer in sleep mode after a certain amount of time. The Energy Star
            program from the Environment Protection Agency estimates that these features can save you up to ‚Çπ3500
            approximately in electricity costs per year, which in turn helps reduce carbon emissions that affect the
            environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            The operating system is often referred to as the <b>software environment</b> or <b>software platform.</b>
            Almost all application programs are designed to run with a specific platform. Android Oreo and Pie (O and P)
            are the latest smartphone operating systems. For example, Apple's iMovie software is designed to run with
            Mac OS environment. Many application, however, have different versions, each designed to operate with a
            particular platform. For example, one version of Microsoft Office is designed to operate with Windows.
            Another version is designed to operate with Mac OS.

                A new start up wants to set up network operating systems for its users. They have a limited budget and
                seek your advice on free and open source operating systems. Reserach and shortlist a few free operating
                systems and provide your recommendations with advantages and disadvantages.
