        <h2>Desktop OS</h2>
        <p id="windows">
            Every personal computer has an operating system controlling its operations. The most widely used desktop
            operating systems are Windows, macOS, UNIX, and Linux.
        </p>

        <h3>Windows</h3>
        <p>
            Microsoft's <b>Windows</b> is the most widely used personal computer operating system. Because its market
            share is so large, more application programs have been developed to run under Windows than any other
            operating system. Windows comes in a variety of different versions and is designed to run with a variety of
            different microprocessors. The three recent versions are Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <a href="f" class="link"> <b>Windows 7</b></a> operating system was made available by Microsoft towards
            the end of 2009. Since Windows
            Vista, the earlier operating system from Microsoft was criticised by many people, Windows 7 was designed to
            replace it. New libraries and file sharing capabilities were added in this operating system. Windows 7, see
            Figure 4-6, was well-received by users. Its performance was also found to be very good as compared to Vista.

            ‚óè <a href="f" class="link"><b>Windows 10</b></a> was announced in 2015. It merges Windows' desktop and
            mobile operating systems. Unlike
            previous Windows versions, Windows 10, see Figure 4-7, runs on all Windows devices, including desktops,
            tablets, and smartphones. This unification has brought several mobile OS innovations to the desktop OS,
            including <b>Contana</b>, a digital assistant that can run on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Other
            innovations include improved gaming with Xbox gaming environment, a new web browser, and support for
            Microsoft HoloLens, an argumented reality tool. Table 4-1 gives a brief description of the Microsoft desktop
            operating systems.

        <h3>macOS</h3>
        <p>
            Apple has been the leader in the development of powerful and easy-to-use personal computer operating systems
            since its introduction of the Macintosh personal computer in 1984. Designed to run only with Apple computer,
            <b>macOS</b> is not as widely used as Windows operating system. As a result, fewer application programs have
            been written for it. However, with increasing sales of Apple computers, the use of macOS has been rapidly
            increasing and is widely recognised as one of the most innovative operating systems. <b>macOS X</b> is the
            most widely used Mac desktop operating system. Three recent versions are mentioned below:
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <a href="f" class="link"><b>macOS Sierra</b></a>, which was announced in 2016 and introduced several
            improvements, including new advanced utilities, improved integration with iOS devices, and better
            integration with cloud computing.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <a href="f" class="link"><b>macOS High Sierra</b></a>, which was announced in 2017, see Figure 4-8. It
            provides a new file system for faster, more secure data storage, improved video compression, and virtual
            reality support. The update includes improvement to Apple applications, such as the Internet browser Safari,
            and the photo application, Photos.
        </p>

        <p id="unix-linux">
            ‚óè <a href="f" class="link"><b>macOS Mojav</b></a>: MacOS Mojav is the 15<sup>th</sup> release of macOS which
            was announced in 2018. Its name is based on Mojav desert.
        </p>

        <h3>UNIX and Linux</h3>
        <p>
            The <b>UNIX</b> operating system was originally designed in the late 1960s to run on minicomputers in
            network environments. Over the years, UNIX has evolved with numerous different versions. Now, it is widely
            used by servers on the web, mainframe computers, and very powerful personal computers. There are a large
            number of different versions of UNIX. <a href="f" class="link"><b>Linux</b></a> is an operating system that
            extended one of the UNIX versions. It was originally developed by a graduate student at the University of
            Helsinki, Linus Torvalds, in 1991. He allowed free distribution of the operating system code and encouraged
            others to modify and further develop the code. Programs released in this way are called <b>open source</b>.
            Linux is a popular and powerful alternative to the Windows operating system, see Figure 4-9. Linux has been
            the basis of several other operating systems. For example, Google's <b>Chrome OS</b> is based on Linux.
            Chrome OS integrates with web servers to run applications and to perform other traditional operating system
            functions. This capability has made Chrome OS a popular choice for inexpensive notebook computers that use
            cloud computing and cloud storage that would normally require expensive hardware. One limitation of these
            computers is that thier efficiency is dependent upon the speed of thier Internet connection.
        </p>

        <h3>Virtualisation</h3>
        <p>
            Application programs are designed to run with particular operating systems. What if you wanted to run two or
            more applications each requiring a different operating system? One solution would be to install each of the
            operating systems on a different computer. There is, however, a way in which a single physical computer can
            support multiple operating systems that operate independently. This approach is called
            <b>virtualisation.</b> When a single physical computer runs a special program known as <b>virtualisation
                software,</b> it operates as though it were two or more separate and independent computers, known as
            <b>virtual machines.</b> Each virtual machine appears to the user as a separate independent computer with
            its own operating system, see Figure 4-10. The operating system of the physical machine is known as the <b>
                host
                operating system</b>. The operating system for each virtual machine is known as the <b>guest operating
                system.</b> Users can readily switch between virtual computers and programs running on them. There are
            several programs that create and run virtual machine that can run Windows and Windows app from within the
            macOS itself.

            After introduction of touch display in computers users have more ways to interact with operating system and
            applications. Identify the cases where touch input provides better experience. Also, list down the cases
            where mouse and physical keyboard are better to work with.
