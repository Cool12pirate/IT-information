        <h2>Mobile Operating System</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Mobile operating systems,</b> also known as <b>mobile OS</b>, are a type of embedded operating system.
            Just like other computer systems, mobile computers, including smartphones, tablets, and wearable computers,
            require an operating system. These mobile operating systems are less complicated and more specialised for
            wireless communication. While there are numerous mobile operating systems, some of the best known are
            Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Android</b> was introduced in 2007. It was originally developed by Android Inc., and later purchased by
            Google. Android is widely used in many of today's smartphones. The latest version of Android is Android P or
            Android Pie.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>iOS</b>, formerly known as <b>iPhone OS</b>, was originally developed in 2007 by Apple. It is based on
            macOS and is used as the platform for Apple's iPad and iPhone, see Figure 4-5. The latest iOS version is iOS
            12.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Windows Phone 7</b> was released in 2010, and after several updates Microsoft released Windows Phone
            7.8 in 2013. In 2012 Windows Phone 8 was released.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Windows 10 Mobile</b> was introduced in 2015 by Microsoft to support a variety of mobile devices,
            including smartphones and tablets. It has the ability to run many powerful programs designed for desktop and
            laptop computers.

            Most smartphone operating systems include a virtual assistant, like Apple's Siri or Google Assistant, that
            scans your personal information such as calendar events, e-mails, text messages, and GPS location to
            anticipate your needs and help organise your life. However, most users of these complex programs are unaware
            that they copy and trasnfer data from texts, e-mails, and GPS, back to company servers. Should your
            operating system be gathering and sharing this data? Who should be in charge of what data is gathered and
            how it is stored?
        </p>

        <p>
            We discussed that not all mobile applications will run on all smartphones. That is because an app is
            designed to run on a particular software platform or operating system. Before downloading an app, be sure
            that it is designed to run with the mobile operating system on your mobile device.
