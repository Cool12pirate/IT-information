        <h2>Data Transmission</h2>
        <p>
            Several factors affect how data is transmitted. These factors include bandwidth and protocols.
        </p>

        <h3>Bandwidth</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Bandwidth</b> is a measurement of the capacity of the communication channel. Effectively, it means how
            much information can move across the communication channel in a given amount of time. For exmaple, to
            transmit text documents, a slow bandwidth would be acceptable. However, to effectively transmit video and
            audio, a higher bandwidth is required. There are four catgories of bandwidth.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Voiceband</b>, also known as <b>low bandwidth</b>, is used for standard telephone communications.
            Personal computers with telephone modems and dial-up service use this bandwidth. While effective for
            transmitting text documents, it is too slow for many types of transmission, including high-quality audio and
            video.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Meidum band</b> is used in special leased lines to connect midrange computers and mainframes as well as
            to transmit data over long distances. This bandwidth is capable of very high speed data transfer.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Broadband</b> is widely used for DSL, Cable, and satellite connections to the Internet. Several users
            can simultaneously use a single broadband connection for high-speed data transfer.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Baseband</b> is widely used to connect individual computers that are located close to another one. Like
            broadband, it is able to support high-speed transmission. Unlike broadband, however, baseband can only carry
            a single at a time.
        </p>

        <h3>Protocols</h3>
        <p>
            For data transmission to be successful, sending and receiving devices must follow a set of communication
            rules for exchange of information. These rules for exchanging data between computers are known as
            <b>protocols</b>. As <a href="www." style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none;">Chapter 2</a>,
            <b>https,</b> or <b>hypertest transfer protocol secure</b>, is widely used to protect the transfer of
            sensitive information. Another widely used Internet protocol is <b>TCP/IP (Transmission Control
                Protocol/Internet Protocol)</b>. The esssential features of this protocol invoice (1) identifying
            sending and receiving devices and (2) breaking information into small parts, or packets, for transmission
            across the Internet.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Identification:</b> Every computer on the Internet has a unique numeric address called an IP address
            (Internet Protocol Address). Similar to the way a postal service uses addresses to deliver mail, the
            Internet uses IP addresses to deliver e-mail and to locate websites. Because these numeric addresses are
            difficult for people to remember and use, a system was developed to automatically convert text-based
            addresses to numeric IP addresses. For example, whenever you enter a URL, say www.mhhe.com, a DNS converts
            this to an IP addresses before a connection can be made, see Figure 8-10.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Packetisation:</b> Information sent or transmitted across the Internet usually travels through numerous
            interconnected networks. Before the message is sent, it is reformatted or broken down into small parts
            called <b>packets</b>. Each packet is then sent separately over the Internet, possibly traveling different
            routes to one common destination. At the receiving end, the packets are reassembled into the correct order.
        </p>

            <span class="con-h">Concept Check</span> <br>
            <b>1.</b> What is bandwidth? Describe the four categories. <br>
            <b>2.</b> What are protocols? What is the standard protocol for the Internet? <br>
            <b>3.</b> Define TCP/IP,IP address, and packets.

        <p class="thi-b">
            <span class="thi-h">Think About It</span> <br>
            Open command terminal in your PC and execute tracert command for Google as follows: C:\>tracert google.com.
            Observe the output and then run the same command for yahho.com. What in your opinion are the differences in
            the output of the two.
