        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>
            Computer communication in the process of sharing data, programs, and information between two or more
            computers. We have discussed numerous applications that depends on communication systems, including:
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>E-mail</b> provide a fast, efficient alternative to traditional mail by sending and receiving
            electronic documents.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Texting</b> provide very efficient direct text communication between individuals using short electronic
            messages.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Videoconferencing</b> provide a low-cost alternative to long-distance telephone calls using electronic
            voice and video delivery.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here, we will focus on the communication systems that support these and many other applications. As the
            power and flexibility of our communication systems have expanded, technological developments of the networks
            that support these systems has become increasingly critical and complex. The network technologies that
            handle our cellular, business, and Internet communications come in many different forms. Satellites,
            boradcast towers, telephone lines, even buried cables and fiber optics carry our telephone messages,
            e-mails, and text messages. These different networks must be able to efficiently and efficitively integrate
            with each other. Connectivity, the wireless revolution, and communication systems are key concepts and
            technologies for the 21st century.
        </p>

        <h3>Connectivity</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Connectivity</b> is a concept related to using computer networks to link people and resources. For
            example, connectivity means that you can connect your personal computer to other computers and information
            sources almost anywhere. With the connection, you are linked to a large number of computers and the
            Internet. This includes hundreds of thousands of web servers and other extensive information resources.
            Thus, being able to efficiently and efficitively use computers becomes a matter of knowing not only about
            connectivity through networks to personal computers but also about larger computer systems and thier
            information resources.
        </p>

        <h3>The Wireless Revolution</h3>
        <p>
            The single most dramatic change in connectivity and communications in the past decades has been the
            widespread use of mobile device like smartphones and tablets with wireless Internet connectivity. Students,
            parents, teachers, businesspeople, and others routinely talk and communicate with these devices. It is
            estimated that over 1.5 billion smartphones are in use worldwide. This wireless technology allows
            individuals to stay connected with one another from almost anywhere and at any time. So what's the
            revolution? While wireless techonology was originally used primarily for voice communications, today's
            mobile computers support e-mail, web access, social networking, and a variety of Internet applications. In
            addition, wireless technology allows a wide variety of nearby devices to communicate with one another
            without any physical connection. Wireless communications allows you to share a high-speed printer, share
            data files, and collaborate on working documents with a nearby co-worker without having your computers
            connected by cables or telephone. High-speed Internet wireless technology allows individuals to connect to
            the Internet and share information from almost anywhere in the world, see Figure 8-1. But is it a
            revolution? Most experts say yes, and that the revolution is just beginning.

        <p class="ethics-b">
            <span class="ethics-h">Ethics</span> <br>
            In the private sector, companies are increasingly using network tools and software to monitor the activity
            of thier employees. Many websites also trach your activity, and goverment officials have often requested
            these records during the course of an investigation. Some believe that it is unethical for goverment and
            businesses to engage in such monitoring and tracking. Do you agree?
        </p>

        <h3>Communication Systems</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Communication systems</b> are electronic systems that transmit data from one location to another. Whether
            wired or wireless, every communication system has four basic elements, see Figure 8-2.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Sending and receiving devices:</b> These are often a computer or specialised communication devices.
            They originate (send) as well as accept (receive) messages in the form of data, information, and/or
            instructions.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Connection devices:</b> These devices act as an interface between the sending and receiving devices and
            communication channel. They convert outgoing messgaes into packets that can travel across the communication
            channel. They also reverse the process for incoming messages.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Data transmission specifications:</b> These are rules and procedures that coordinate the sending and
            receiving devices by precisely defining how the message will be sent across the communication channel.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Communication Channel:</b> This is the actual connecting or transmission medium that carries the
            message. This medium can be physical wire or cable, or it can be wireless.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, if you wanted to send an email to a friend, you could create and send the message using the
            computer, the <em>sending device</em>. Your modem, a <em>connection device</em>, would modify and format the
            message so that it could travel efficiently across <em>communication channels</em>, such as telephone lines.
            The specifics describing how the message is modified, reformatted, and sent would be described in the
            <em>data transmission specifications</em>. After your message travelled across the channel, the receiver's
            modem, a connection device, would reformat it so that it could be diplayed on your friend's computer, the
            <em>receiving device</em>. (Note: This example presents the basic communication system elements involved in
            sending e-mail. It does not and is not intended to demonstrate all the specific steps and equipment involved
            in an e-mail delivery system.)
