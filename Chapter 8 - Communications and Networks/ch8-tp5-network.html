        <h2>Network</h2>
        <p>
            A <b>computer network</b> is a communication system that connects two or more computers on that they can
            exchange information and share resources. Networks can be set up in different arrangements to suit users'
            needs, see Figure 8-11.
        </p>

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <p>
            There are a number of specialised terms that describe computer networks. These terms include
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Node:</b> Any device that is connected to a network. It could be a computer, printer, or data storage
            device.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Client:</b> A node that requests and uses resources available from other nodes. Typically, a client is
            a user's personal computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Server:</b> A node that shares resources with other nodes. Dedicated server specialise in performing
            specific tasks. Depending on the specific task, they may be called an application server, communication
            server, database server, file server, printer server, or web server.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Directory server:</b> A specialised server that manages resources, such as user accounts, for an entire
            network.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Host:</b> Any computer system connected to a network that provides access to its resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Router:</b> A node that coordinates the flow of data by sending messages directly between sender and
            receiver nodes. A hub previously filled this purpose by sending message to all connected nodes, rather than
            just the intended node.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Switch:</b> Central node that coordinates that flow of data by sending messages directly between sender
            and receiver nodes. A hub previously filled this purpose by sending a received message to all connected
            nodes, rather than just the intended node.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Network Interface Cards (NIC):</b> As discussed in <a href="www."
                style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none;">Chapter 5</a>, there are expansion cards located within
            the system unit that connect the computer to a network. Sometimes referred to as a LAN adapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Network Operating Systems (NOS):</b> Control and coordinate the activities of all computers and other
            devices on a network. These activities include electronic communication and the sharing of information and
            resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Network Administrator:</b> A computer specialist responsible for efficient network operations and
            implementation of new networks.
        </p>


        <p>
            A network may consist only of personal computers, or it may integrate personal computers or other devices
            with larger computers. Networks can be controlled by all nodes working together equally or by specialised
            nodes coordinating and supplying all resources. Networks may be simple or complex, self-contained or
            dispersed over a large geographic area.
        </p>

        <h2>Network Type</h2>
        <p>
            Clearly, different types of channels-wired or wireless-allow different kinds of networks to be formed.
            Telephone lines, for instance, may connect communications equipment within the same building or within a
            home. Networks also may be citywide and even international, using both cable and wireless connections. Local
            area, mteropolitan area, and wide area networks are distinguished by the size of the geographic area they
            serve.
        </p>

        <h3>Local Area Networks</h3>
        <p>
            Networks with nodes that are in close physical proximity-within the same building, for instance-are called
            <b>Local Area Network (LANs)</b>. Typically, LANs span distances less than a mile and are owned and operated
            by individual organisations. LANs are widely used by colleges, universities, and other types of
            organisations to link personal computers and to share printers and other resources. For a simple LAN, see
            Figure 8-12. The LAN representated in Figure 8-12 is a typical arrangement and provides two benefits:
            economy and flexibility. People can share costly equipment. For instance, the four personal computers share
            the high-speed laser printer and the file server, which are expensive pieces of hardware. Other equipment or
            nodes also may be added to the LAN, for instance, more personal computers, a mainframe computer, or optical
            disc storage devices. Additionally, the <b>network gateway</b> is a device that allows one LAN to be linked
            to other LANs or to larger networks. For example, the LAN of one office group may be connected to the LAN of
            another office group. There are a variety of different standards or ways in which nodes can be connected to
            one another and ways in which thier communications are controlled in a LAN. The most common standard is
            known as <b>Ethernet</b>. LANs using this standard are sometimes referred to as Ethernet LANs.
        </p>

        <h3>Home Networks</h3>
        <p>
            While LANs have been widely used within organisations for years, they are now being commonly used by
            individuals in thier homes and apartments. These LANs, called <b>home networks</b>, allow different
            computers to share resources, including a common internet connection. Computers can be connected in a
            variety of ways, including electrical wiring, telephone wiring, and special cables. One of the simplest
            ways, however, is without cables, or wireless.
        </p>

        <h3>Wireless LAN</h3>
        <p>
            A wireless local area network is typically referred to as a <b>Wireless LAN (WLAN)</b>. It uses radio
            frequencies to connect computers and other devices. All communications pass through the network's centrally
            located wireless access point or base station. This access point interprets incoming radio frequencies and
            routes communications to the appropriate devices. Wireless access points that provide Internet access are
            widely available in public places such as coffee shops, libraries, bookstores, colleges, and universities.
            These access points are known as <b>hotspots</b> and typically use Wi-Fi technology. Many of these services
            are free locator sites such as www.hotspot-location.com. Most mobile computing devices have an internal
            wireless network card to connect to hotspots. If your mobile device does not have an internal wireless
            network card, you can use an external wireless adapter, see Figure 8-13 that plugs into your computer's USB
            port or PC card slot.
        </p>

        <h3>Personal Area Network</h3>
        <p>
            A <b>Personal Area Network (PAN)</b> is a type of wireless network that works within a very small area-your
            immediate surroundings. PANs connect cell phones to headsets, keyboards to cell phones, and so on. These
            networks make it possible for wireless devices to interact with each other. The most popular PAN technology
            is Bluetooth, with a maximum range of around 33 feet. Virtually all wireless peripheral devices available
            today use Bluetooth, including the controllers on popular game systems like the PlayStation and Wii.
        </p>

        <h3>Metropolitan Area Networks</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN)</b> span distances up to 100 miles. These networks are frequently used
            as links between office buildings that are located throughout a city. Unlike a LAN, a MAN is typically not
            owned by a single organisation. Rather, it is owned either by a group of organisations or by a single
            network service provider that provides network services for a fee.
        </p>

        <h3>Wide Area Networks</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Wide Area Network (WANs)</b> are countrywide and worldwide networks. These networks provide access to
            regional service (MAN) providers and typically span distances greater than 100 miles. They use microwave
            relays and satellites to reach users over long distances-for example, from Los Angeles to Paris. Of course,
            the widest of all WANs is the Internet, which spans the entire globe. The primary difference between a PAN,
            LAN, MAN and WAN is the geographic range. Each may have various combinations of hardware, such as a personal
            computers, midrange computers, mainframes, and various peripheral devices. For summary of network types,
            refere Table 8-4.

            <span class="tip-h">Tips</span> <br>
            Do you use your laptop to connect to wireless networks at school or in public places such as coffee shops,
            airports, or hotels? If so, it is impossible to use caution to protect your computer and your privacy. Here
            are a few suggestions: <br>

            <b style="font-weight: 900;">1.</b> <b>Use a fireball</b>: A personal firewall is essential when connecting
            your computer directly to public networks. Some firewalls, such as the one built into Windows 7, Windows 8
            and Windows 10, will ask whether a new network should be treated as home, work, or a public network. <br>

            <b style="font-weight: 900;">2.</b> <b>Avoid Fake hotspots</b>: Thieves are known to set up rogue (or fake)
            hotspots in popular areas where users expect free Wi-Fi, such as coffee shops and airports. Since many
            operating systems automatically connect to the access point with the strongest signal, you could be
            connecting to the one set up by the thief. Always confirm that you are connecting to the access point of
            that establishment. Ask an employee if you are unsure. <br>
            <b style="font-weight: 900;">3.</b> <b>Turn off file sharing</b>: Turning off file-sharing feature in your
            operating system will ensure that no one can access or modify your files. <br>
            <b style="font-weight: 900;">4.</b> <b>Check if connection is encrypted</b>: If the hotspots you are using
            is protected with a password then it is likely encrypted. If it is not, then be very careful with websites
            you visit and the information you provide.
