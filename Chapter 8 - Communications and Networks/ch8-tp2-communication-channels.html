        <h2>Communication Channels</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Communication channels</b> are an essential element of every communication system. These channels
            actually carry the data from one computer to another. There are two categories of communication channels.
            One category connects sending and receiving devices by providing a physical connection, such as a wire or
            cable. The other category is wireless.
        </p>

        <h3>Physical Connections </h3>
        <p>
            Physical connections use a solid medium to connect sending and receiving devices. These connections include
            twisted-pair, coaxial, and fiber-optic cables.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Twisted-pair cable</b> consists of pairs of copper wire that are twisted together. Both standard
            <b>telephone lines</b> and <b>Ethernet Cables</b> use twisted pair, see Figure 8-3. Ethernet cables are
            often used in networks and to connect a variety of components to the system unit.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Coaxial cable,</b> a high-frequency transmission cable, replaces the multiple wires of telephone line
            with a single solid-copper core, see Figure 8-4. In terms of the number of telephone connections, a coaxial
            cable has over 80 times the transmission capacity of twisted pair. Coaxial cable is used to deliver
            television signals as well as to connect computers in a network.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Fiber-optic cable</b> transmits data as pulses of light through tiny tubes of glass, see Figure 8-5.
            The data transmission speeds of fiber-optic cables are very high; recently speeds of 1 petabit per second
            were measured (a petabit is 1 million gigabits). Compared to coaxial cable, it is lighter, faster, and more
            reliable at transmitting data. Fiber-optic cable is rapidly replacing twisted-cable telephone lines.
        </p>

        <h3>Wireless Connections </h3>
        <p>
            Wireless connections do not use a solid substance to connect sending and receiving devices. Rather, they
            move data through the air. Most wireless connections use radio waves to communicate. For example,
            smartphones and many other Internet-enabled devices use radio wave to place telephone calls to connect to
            the Internet. Primary technologies used for wireless connections are Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, microwave, WiMax,
            cellular, and satellite connections.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Bluetooth</b> is a short-range radio communication standard that transmits data over short distances of
            up to approximately 33 feet. Bluetooth is widely used for wireless headsets, printer connections, and
            handheld devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)</b> uses high-frequency radio signals to transmit data. A number of standards
            of Wi-Fi exist, and each can send and receive data at different speed, refer table 8-1. Most home and
            business wireless networks use Wi-Fi.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Microwave</b> communication uses high-frequency radio waves. It is sometimes referred to as
            line-of-sight communication because microwaves can be transmitted only over relatively short distance. Thus,
            microwave is a good medium for sending data between buildings in a city or on a large college campus. For
            longer distances, the waves must be relayed by using microwave stations the microwave dishes or antennas,
            see Figure 8-6.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>WiMax (Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access)</b> is a new standard that extends the range of
            Wi-Fi networks using microwave connections. WiMax is commonly used by universities and others to extend the
            capability of existing Wi-Fi networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Cellular</b> communication uses multiple antennae (<b>cell towers</b>) to send and receive data within
            relatively small geographic regions (<b>cells</b>). Most cell phones and mobile devices use cellular
            networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Satellite</b> communication uses satellite orbiting about 22,000 miles above the earth as microwave
            relay stations. Intelsat, the International Telecommunication Satellite Consortium, which is owned by 114
            governments and forms a worldwide communication system provides a number of series through satellite
            communication system provides a number of services. Satellites orbit at a precise point and speed above the
            earth. They can amplify and relay microwave signals from one transmitter on the ground to another. Satellite
            can be used to send and recieve large volumes of data. <b>Uplink</b> is a term relating to sending data to a
            satellite. <b>Downlink</b> refers to receiving data from a satellite. The major drawback to satellite
            communication is that bad weather can sometimes interuppt the flow of data. One of the most interesting
            applications of satellite communications is for global positioning. A network of satellites owned and
            managed by the Department of Defense continuously send location information of earth. Global Positioning
            System (GPS) devices use that information to uniquely determine the geographic location of the device.
            Available in many automobiles to provide navigational support, these systems are often mounted into the dash
            with a monitor to display maps and speakers to provide spoken directions. Most of today's smartphones and
            tablet use GPS technology for handheld navigation, see Figure 8-7.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike radio waves, infrared uses <b>infrared</b> light waves to communicate over short distances. Like
            microwave transmissions, infrared is a line-of-sight communication. Because light waves can only travel in a
            straight line, sending and receiving devices must be in clear view of one another without any obstructions
            blocking the view. One of the most common infrared devices is the TV remote channel.
