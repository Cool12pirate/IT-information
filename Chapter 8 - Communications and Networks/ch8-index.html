        <p class="start-p1">Communications and networks are the backbone of naerly every aspect of modern digital life.
            In the future, telepresence (the ability to fully experience the reality of a different place without
            actually being there) will be commonplace. For example, doctors will routinely perform surgery on patients
            located hailway around the world! <br>
            This page covers the things you need to know to be prepared for this ever-changing digital world, including:
        </p>

        <ol class="start-ol1" type="1">
            <li>Learning about coaxial and fiber-optic cables so you can make smart decisions about home Internet
                connections.</li>
            <li>Using your digital devices in smarter and safer ways by understanding Wi-Fi, satellites, and Bluetooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Becoming a digital road warrior using 4G and 5G data networks and GPS.

            <b>After reading this page, you should be able to:</b> <br>
            <b>1.</b> Explain connectivity, the wireless revolution, and communication systems. <br>
            <b>2.</b> Describe physical and wireless communication channels. <br>
            <b>3.</b> Differentiate between connection devices and services, including dial-up, DSL, cable, satellite
            and cellular. <br>
            <b>4.</b> Describe data transmission factors, including bandwidths and protocols. <br>

            â–¶ Ganpat is working on a software development project and often has to share his live screen with his
            manager Vaishali for approval. But there is one problem. Both sit in different locations. Ganpat has been
            sharing his screen using Print Screen option, which is time consuming. Vaishali tells him to use one of the
            easily available software like TeamViewer, AnyDesk and Join.me. Taking Vaishali's advice, information
            sharing between two has greatly improved. This is a clear example of wireless revolution and the basis of
            communication channels.
