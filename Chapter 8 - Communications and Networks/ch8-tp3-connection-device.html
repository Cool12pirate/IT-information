        <h2>Connection Device</h2>
        <p>
            At one time nearly all computer communication used telephone lines. However, becuase the telephone was
            originally designed for voice transmission, telephones typically send and receive <b>analog signals,</b>
            which are continuous electronic waves. Computers, in contrast, send and receive <b>digital signals</b>, see
            Figure 8-8. These represent the presence or absence of an electronic pulse-the on/off binary signals we
            mentioned in <a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700;" href="www.">Chapter 5</a>. To convert the
            digital signals to analog signals and vice versa, you need a modem.
        </p>

        <h3>Modem</h3>
        <p>
            The word <b>modem</b> is short for <em>modulator-demodulator.</em> <b>Modulation</b> is the process of
            converting from digital to analog. <b>Demodulation</b> is the process of converting from analog to digital.
            The modem enables digital personal computers to communicate across different media, including telephone
            wires, cable lines, and radio waves. The speed with which modems transmit data varies. This speed, called
            <b>transfer rate</b>, is typically measured in millions of bits <b>(megabits) per seconds (Mbps)</b>, refer
            Table 8-3. The higher the speed, the faster you can send and receive information. For example, to download a
            complete full-length montion picture (700 MB) on a 1.5-Mbps modem would take about 1 hour. Using a 10.0-Mbps
            modem would take about 9 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three commonly used modems: DSL, cable, and wireless see Figure 8-9.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè A <b>DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)</b> modem uses standard phone lines to create a high-speed connection
            directly to your phone company's offices. These devices usually external and connect to the system unit
            using either USB or Ethernet ports.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè A <b>cable modem</b> uses the same coaxial cable as your television. Like a DSL modem, a cable modem
            creates high-speed connections using the system unit's USB or Ethernet port.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè A <b>wireless modem</b> is also known as <b>WWAN (Wireless Wide Area Network) modem.</b> Almost all
            computers today have built-in wireless modems. For those that do not, wireless adapter cards are available
            that plug into USB or special card ports.
        </p>

        <h3>Connection Service</h3>
        <p>
            For years, large corporations have been leasing special high-speed lines from telephone companies.
            Originally, these were copper lines, known as <b>T1</b> lines, that could be combined to from
            higher-capacity options known as <b>T3</b> or DS3 lines. These lines have largely been replaced by faster
            <b>Optical Carrier (OC)</b> lines. While the special high-speed lines are too costly for most individuals,
            service providers do provide affordable connections. For years, individuals relied on <b>dial-up
                services</b> using existing telephones and telephone modems to connect to the Internet. This type of
            service include DSL, cable, staellite, and cellular services, refer Table 8-3.

            ‚óè <b>Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)</b> service provided by telephone companies using existing telephone
            lines to provide high-speed connections. <b>ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)</b> is one of the most
            widely used types of DSL. DSL is much faster than dial-up.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Cable service</b> is provided by cable television companies using thier existing television cables.
            These connections are usually faster than DSL.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Fiber Optic Service (FiOS)</b> is showing up in some areas, but it is a new technology and not widely
            available. Current providers of FiOS include Reliance Jio, Google and Verizon with speeds faster than cable
            or DSL connections.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Satellite connection services</b> use satellite to provide wireless connections. While slower than DSL
            and cable modem, satellite connections are available almost anywhere using a satellite-receiving disk.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Cellular service providers,</b> including Varizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile, support voice and
            transmission to wireless devices using cellular networks. These networks have gone through different
            generations. <b>First-generations mobile telecommunications (1G) </b> started in the 1980s using analog
            radio signals to provide analog voice transmission service. <b>Second-generations mobile telecommunications
                (2G)</b> started in the 1990s using digital radio signals. <b>Third-generation mobile telecommunications
                (3G)</b> started in the 2000s and provided services capable of effective connectivity to the Internet,
            marking the beginning of smartphones.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Fourth-generation mobile telecommunications (4G)</b> use <b>LTE (Long Term Evolution)</b> connections to
            provide faster Internet access, allowing smartphones to easily stream videos and music. 4G was launched in
            India by Airtel in 2012 in Kolkata. 4G can reach speeds up to 100Mbits/s. <b>4G</b> technology is gradually
            being replaced by <b>4G+</b> which can reach up to or over 1Gbits/s. The <b>fifth-generations mobile
                telecommunications (5G)</b> is being developed, with speeds that rival home Internet connections and is
            expected to be widely available by 2020.
