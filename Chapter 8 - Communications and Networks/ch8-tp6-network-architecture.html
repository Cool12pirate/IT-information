        <h2>Network Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Network architecture</b> describe how a network is arranged and how resources are coordinated and shared.
            It encompasses a variety of different network specifics, including network topologies and strategies.
            Network topology describes the physical arrangement of the network. Network strategies define how
            information and resources are shared.
        </p>

        <h3>Topologies</h3>
        <p>
            A network can be arranged or configured in several different ways. This arrangement is called the network's
            <b>topology</b>. The most common topologies are:
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Bus network</b> : Each device is connected to a common cable called a bus or backbone, and all
            communications travel along this bus.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Ring network</b> : Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a ring, see Figure 8-14. When
            a message is sent, it is passed around the ring until it reaches the intended destination.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Star network</b> : Device is connected directly to a central network switch, see Figure 8-15. Whenever
            a
            node sends a message, it is routed to the switch, which then passes the message along to the intended
            recipient. The star network is the most widely used network topology today. It is applied to a broad range
            of applications from small networks is the home to very large networks in major corporations.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Tree network</b> : Each device is connected to a central node, either directly or through one or more
            other devices. The central node is connected to two or more subcordinate nodes that in turn are connected to
            other subordinate node, and so forth, forming a treelike structure, see Figure 8-16. This network, also
            known as a hierarchical network, is often used to share corporatewide data.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Mesh network</b> : This topology is the newest type and does not use a specific physical layout (such
            as a star or a tree). Rather, the mesh network requires that each node have more than one connection to the
            other nodes, see Figure 8-17. The resulting pattern forms the appearance of a mesh. If a path between two
            nodes is somehow disrupted, data can be automatically rerouted using another path. Wireless technologies are
            frequently used to build mesh networks.

        <h3>Strategies</h3>
        <p>
            Every network has a <b>strategy</b>, or a way of coordinating the sharing of information and resources. Two
            of the most common network strategies are client/server and peer-to-peer. <b>Client/server networks</b> use
            central servers to coordinate and supply services to other nodes on the network. The server provides access
            to resources such as web pages, databases, application software, and hardware, see Figure 8-18. This
            strategy is based on specialisation. Server nodes coordinate and supply specialised services, and client
            nodes request the services. Commonly used server operating systems are Windows Server, Mac OS X Server,
            Linux, and Solaris. Client/server networks are widely used on the Internet. For example, each time you open
            a web browser, your computer (the client) sends out a request for a specific web page. This request is
            routed over the Internet to a server. This server locates and sends the requested material back to your
            computer. One advantage of the client/server network strategy is the ability to handle very large networks
            efficiently. Another advantage is the availability of powerful network management software to monitor and
            control network activities. The major disadvantages are the cost of installation and maintenance. In a
            <b>peer-to-peer (P2P)</b> network, nodes have equal authority and can act as both clients and servers. The
            most common way to share games, movies, and music over the Internet is to use P2P network. For example,
            special file-sharing such as BitTorrent can be used to obtain files located on another personal computer and
            also can provide files to other personal computers. P2P networks are rapidly growing in popularity as people
            continue to share information with others around the world. The primary advantage is that they are easy and
            inexpensive (often free) to set up and use. One disadvantage of P2P networks is the lack of security
            controls or other common management functions. For this reason, few businesses use this type of network to
            communicate sensitive information.
