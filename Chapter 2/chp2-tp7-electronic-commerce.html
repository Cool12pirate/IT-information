            <h1>&#9769 Electronic Commerce</h1>
            <p>
                Electronic commerce, also known as e-commerce, is the buying and selling goods over the Internet. Electronic commerce is fast-growing and widely used because it provide incentives 
                for both buyers and sellers. From the buyer's perspective, goods and services can be purchased at any time of day or night from any location that has an Internet connection. From 
                the seller's perspective, the costs associated with owning and operating a retail outlet can be eliminated. Another advantage is reduced inventory. Traditional stores maintain an 
                inventory of goods in thier stores and periodically relenish this inventory from warhouses. With e-commerce, there is no in-store inventory and products are shipped directly from 
                warhouses. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">While</span> there are numerous advantages to e-commerce, there are disadvantages as well. Some of these disadvantages include the inability  to 
                purchase all types of goods, e.g., persihable, and lack of guarantee of quality product and questions relating to the security of online payments. Although these issues are being 
                addressed, very few observers suggest that e-commerce will replace bricks-and-mortar businesses entirely. It is clear that both will coexist and that e-commerce will continue to 
                grow. üí∏ <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Just</span> like any other type of commerce, electronic commerce involves two parties: businesses and consumers. There are three basic types of 
                electronic commerce:
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>Business-to-consumer (B2C)</b> commerce involves the sale of a product or service to the general public or end users. It is the fastest-growing type of commerce. Whether large or \
                small, nearly every existing corporation provides some type of B2C support as another means to connect to customers. Because extensive investments are not required to create 
                traditional retail outlets and to maintain large marketing and sales staffs, e-commerce allows start-up companies to complete with larger established firms. The three most widely 
                used B2C applications are for online banking, financial trading, and shopping. Flipkart, Amazon, Myntra are some of the most widely used B2C websites.

            <li>
                <b>Consumer-to-consumer (C2C)</b> commerce involves individuals selling to individuals ü§ù. C2C often takes the form of an electronic version of the classified ads or an auction. 
                <b>Web auctions</b> are similar to traditional auctions expect that buyers sellers seldom, if ever, meet face to face. Sellers post descriptions of products at a website, and buyers submit 
                bids electronically. Like traditional auctions, sometimes the bidding becomes highly competitive and enthusiatic. Some of the popular auction sites are eBay, OLX, ExtraCarbon and Quickr. 
                These sites also have mobile apps for convenience. For a list of some of the most popular web auction sites, refer Table 2-8.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Business-to-business (B2B)</b> commerce involves the sale of a product or service from one business to another. This is typically a manufracturer-supplier relationship. For example, a furniture 
                manufracturer requires raw materials, such as  wood, paint and varnish.

            <h2>üîí Security</h2>
            <p>
                The two greatest challenges for e-commerce are (1) developing fast, secure and reliable playments methods for purchased goods and (2) providing convenient ways to submit required 
                information such as mailing addresses and credit card information. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">The</span> two basic payment options are credit/debit card and digital cash:
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>Credit</b> or <b>Debit card</b> purchases are faster and more convenient than cheque purchases. Credit card fraud, however, is a major concern for both buyers and sellers.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Digital Cash</b> is the Internet's equivalent to traditional cash. Buyers purchase digital cash from a third party (a bank that specialises in electronic currency) and use it 
                to purchase goods, see Figure 2-13. Sellers convert the digital cash to traditional currency through a third party. Although not as convenient as credit/debit card purchases, digital 
                cash is more secure. Digital cash systems are protected by password/pins. There must be kept secret by users. Also, the authenticity of such systems must be checked before registering 
                for thier services. For a list of digital cash providers, refer Table 2-9.
