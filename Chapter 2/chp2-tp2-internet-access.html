            <p>
                Your computer is a very powerful tool. However, It needs to be connected to the Internet to truly unleash its power. Once on the Internet, your computer becomes an extension of what 
                seems like a giant computer-a computer that branches all over the world. When provided with a connection to the Internet, you can use a browser program to search the web.

            <h2>&#8886 Providers &#8887</h2>
            <p>
                The most common way to access the Internet is through an <b>Internet Service Provider (ISP)</b>. The providers are already connected to the Internet and provide a path of connection 
                for individuals to access the Internet. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">The</span> most widely used commercial ISPs use telephone lines, cable and/or wireless connections. Some of the best-known service providers in India are 
                BSNL, Bharti Airtel, Jio, and Vodafone Idea.

            <p>
                <b>Browsers</b> are programs that provide access to web resources. This software connects you to remote computers; opens and transfer files; displays text, images, and multimedia, and 
                provide an uncomplicated interface to the Internet and web documents. Four well-known browsers are Google Chrome, Mozilla FireFox, Internet Explorer and Apple Safari, see Figure 2-2.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30%;"><b>Figure 2-2</b> Browser (Google Chrome)</p>

            <p>
                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">For</span> browsers to connect to resources, the <b>location</b> or <b>address</b> of the resources must be specified. These addresses are called <b>Uniform 
                Resource Locator (URLs).</b> All URLs have at least two basic parts.
            </p>

            <img src="parts-url_0.jpg" alt="parts-of-url.jpg" width="25%" style="margin-left: 36%;">
            <p style="margin-left: 36%;"><b>Figure 2-3</b> Basic parts of URL</p>

            <p>
                <b>1.</b> The first part presents the protocol used to connect the resources. <b>Protocols</b> are rules for exchanging data between computers. The protocol <i>https</i> is used for 
                web traffic and is one of the most secure and widely used Internet protocols. <br>

                <b>2.</b> The second part presents the <b>domain name</b>. It indicates the specific address where the resource is located. In figure 2-3, domain is identified as <b>www.google.com.</b> 
                The last part of the domain name following the dot (.) is the <b>Top-level Domain (TLD)</b>. Also known as the <b>web suffix,</b> it typically  indentifies the type of organisations. For example, 
                <i>.com</i> indicates a commercial site, see Table 2-1. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Once</span> the browser has connected to the website, a document file is sent to your computer. This document typically contains <b>Hypertext Markup 
                Language (HTML),</b> a markup language for displaying web pages. The browser interprets the HTML formatting instructions and displays the document as a <b>web page.</b> For example, 
                when your browser first connects to the Internet, it opens up to a web page specified in the browser settings. Web pages present information about the site along with references and 
                <b>hyperlinks</b> or <b>links</b> that connect to other documents containing related information-text files, graphic images, audio and video clips. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Various</span> technologies are used to provide highly interactive and animated websites. These technologies include:

                <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> are separate file referenced by or lines inserted into an HTML document that controls the appearance of a web page. CSS help ensure that related 
                web pages have a consistent presentation or look. Netflix uses CSS to visually connect all its web pages.

                <b>JavaScript</b> is a language often used within HTML documents to trigger interactive features, such as opening new browser windows and checking information entered in online form. 
                The Microsoft search engine Bing.com uses Javascript to make its website more interactive and to assist its users by auto-filling search requests as they content into the search box.

                <b>PHP,</b> like Javascript, is a language often used with HTML documents to improve a website's interactivity. Unlike Javascript, which is executed on the user's computer, PHP executes 
                on the website's computer.

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Today</span> it is common to access the Internet from a variety of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. Special browsers called <b>mobile browsers</b>
                are designed to run on these portable devices. Unlike a traditional web browser that is typically displayed on a large screen, a mobile browser is displayed on a very small screen and special 
                navigational tools are required to conveniently view web content. The smartphones for example enables you to 'pinch' or 'stretch' the screen with two fingers to zoom web content in and out, see
                Figure 2-4.

                Are you getting the most out of your web browser? Here are a few suggestions to make you faster and more efficient. <br> <br>

                <b>1. Bookmarks/Favorites Bar:</b> Most browsers have a bookmarks or favorite bar just below the address bar. Add your top 5 or 10 most often-visited websites here. The next time you 
                want to visit one of these sites, select it from the bookmarks/favorites list rather than entering the site URL. <br>

                <b>2. Shortcuts:</b> Keyboard shortcuts are often faster than using a mouse. Use the following: F5 (refresh); Alt + left arrow (Back); Ctrl + W (close tab); Ctrl + E (adds 'www' and 'com' to 
                any domain you type in the address bar.) <br> 

                <b>3. Extensions/Add-Ons:</b> Many browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox, allow users to install small, third-party programs that extend, or add to, the capabilities of the browser. 
                These programs can perform a variety of tasks, from providing easy access to cloud services to making it easier to capture information on a web page. <br>

                <b>4. Configure Settings:</b> All browsers have a settings or options page that provides ways to improve the security and privacy of Internet browsing. For example, you can deny 
                websites from automatically opening up another browser window, called pop-ups (these annoying windows often contain advertisements).
