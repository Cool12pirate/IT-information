            <p>
                <b>E-Mail</b> or <b>electronic mail</b> is the transmission of electronic messages over the Internet. A typical e-mail message has three basic elements: header, message and signature, see 
                Figure 2-11. The header appears first and typically the following information:
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>Addresses:</b> E-Mail messages typically display the addresses of the person or persons to whom the e-mail is sent. The e-mail messages in Figure 2-11 is to pg@goeleduinstitue.com. 
                E-mail addresses have two basic parts, see Figure 2-12. The first part is the user's name and the second part is the domain name, which includes the top-level domain. In our e-mail 
                example, <i>pg</i> is Priyanka's user name. The server providing e-mail service for Priyanka is <i>poeleduinstitude.com</i>. The top-level domain indicates that the provider is an 
                educational institution.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Subject:</b> A one-line description, used to present the topic of the messages. Subject lines typically are displayed when a person checks his or her mailbox.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Attachments:</b> Many e-mail programs allow you to attach files such as documents and images. If a message has an attachments, the file name typically appears on the attachment line.
            </li>

            <p>
                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">The</span> letter or <b>message</b> comes next. Finally, the <b>signature</b> identifies the sender. This information may include the sender's name, address 
                and telephone number, company's website address and social media handles. E-mail can be a valuable asset in your personal and professional life. However, like many other valuable technologies, 
                there are drawbacks too. We receive billions of unwanted and unsolicited e-mails every year. These unwelcome mails are called <b>spam</b>. While spam is indeed a distraction and nuisance, it 
                also can be dangerous. For example, computer viruses, bugs and destructive programs often attached to unsolicited e-mail. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">India</span> does not have any anti-spam law. What we have is <b>Information Technology Act</b> which speaks of punishment for misusing confidentail 
                information. A more effective approach to control spam has been the development and use of <b>spam blockers</b>, also knwon as <b>spam filters</b>. Most e-mail programs provide 
                limited spam-blocking capabilities. Additionally, powerful specialised spam-blocking programs are available. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">There</span> are two basic types of e-mail systems: client-based and web-based.
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>Client-based e-mail systems</b> require a special program known as an <b>e-mail client</b> to be installed on your computer. Before you can begin e-mailing, you need to run the 
                e-mail client from your computer, which communicates with the e-mail service provider. two of the most widely used e-mail client are Microsoft's Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Web-based e-mail systems</b> do not require an e-mail program to be installed on your computer. Once your computer's browser connects to an e-mail service provider, a special program 
                called a <b>webmail client</b> is run on the e-mail provider's computer and then you can begin e-mailing. This is knwon as <b>webmail</b>. Most Internet service providers offer webmail 
                services. Three free webmail service providers are Google's Gmail, Microsoft's Hotmail and Yahoo! Mail.
            </li>

            <p>
                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">For</span> individuals use, webmail is more widely used because it frees the user from installing and maintaining an e-mail client on every computer used to 
                access e-mail. With webmail, you can access your e-mail from any computer anywhere that has Internet access.

                Are you tired of sorting through an inbox full of spam? Here are a few spam-reducing suggestions: <br>
                <b>1. Keep a low profile:</b> Many spammers collect e-mail addresses from personal web pages, social networking sites and messages boards. Be cautious when posting your address. <br>
                <b>2. Use caution when giving out your address:</b> Many companies collect and sell e-mail addresses to spammers. Be sure to read the privacy policy of a site before providing your address. <br>
                <b>3. Don't ever respond to spam:</b> Many are a trick to validate active e-mail addresses. These addresses are worth more to spammers, who then sell the addresses to other spammers. <br>
                <b>4. Use antispam and filter options:</b> Most e-mail programs and web-based e-mail services have antispam and filter options that can be configured. Use them.

                While e-mail was one of the first and is one of the most popular electronic messaging systems, other messaging systems have followed. Two of the best known are text messaging and instant 
                messaging. 
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>Text messaging</b>, also knwon as texting or <b>SMS (short message service)</b>, is the process of sending a short electronic message, typically less than 160 characters, using a 
                wireless network to another person, who views the message on a mobile device such as a smartphone. Today, billions of people send text message every day. It has become one of the most 
                widely used ways to send very short messages from one individual to another. While text messaging was originally limited to characters, you can now send images, video, and sound using 
                a variation of SMS known as <b>MMS (multimedia messaging service).</b> Although popular and convenient, there are downsides to using this technology in the wrong way. A great deal of 
                attention has been directed towards texting while driving. Studies have concluded that texting while driving had a great negative impact on driver safety than being drunk. Several 
                countries have passed laws prohibiting texting while driving.

            <li>
                <b>Instant messaging (IM)</b> allows two or more people to contact each other via direct, live communication. To use instant messaging, you register with an instant messaging service, 
                such as Facebook or Google+ or WhatsApp, and then specify a list of <b>friends</b>. Whenever you connect to the Internet, your IM service is notified. It then notfies you of all your 
                friends who are available to chat and notifies your friends who are online that you are available. You can then send message directly back and forth to one another. Most instant messaging 
                programs also include video conferencing features, file sharing and remote assistance. Many businesses routinely use these instant messaging features. Few instant messaging services are WhatsApp, 
                Facebook Messenger, Skype, Telegram, etc.
