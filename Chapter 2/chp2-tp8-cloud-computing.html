            <h1>‚òÅ Cloud Computing</h1>
            <p>
                Typically, application programs are owned by individulas and stored on thier computer system's hard disks. As discussed <b>cloud computing</b> uses the Internet and the web to shift 
                many of these computer activities from the user's computing to other computers on the Internet. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">While</span> some suggest that cloud computing is merely a marketing term designed to promote new products, many others see cloud computing as new 
                model for computing that free users from owing, maintaining and storing software and data. It provides access to these services from anywhere through an Internet connection. 
                Several prominent firms are aggressively pursuing this new concept. These firms include Google, IBM, Intel and Microsoft to name just a few. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">The</span> basic components of cloud computing are clients, the Internet and service providers, see Figure 2-14.

                <b>Clients</b> are corporations and end users who want to access data, programs and storage. To have easy access, anywhere, anytime what is required is Internet connectivity. End users 
                do not need to buy, install and maintain application programs and data.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>The Internet</b> provides the connection between the clients and the providers. Two of the most critical factors determining the efficiency of cloud computing are (1) speed of the 
                Internet and its reliability for the user to access it and (2) the capability of Internet to transmit data without any problem.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Service providers</b> are organisations with computers connected to the Internet that are willing to provide access to software, data and storage. These providers may charge a fee 
                or may be free. For example, Google drive apps provide free access to programs like Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides with capabilities similar to Microsoft's word, Excel 
                and Powerpoint (see Figure 2-15).
