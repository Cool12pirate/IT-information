            <h1>&#9769 The Internet and The Web</h1>
            <p>
                The <b>Internet</b> is a network of several computer which are interconnected with each other. It is the foundation of the digital era and allows people around the world to share 
                data in form of words, images and any digital file instantaneously. The Internet is a large network that connects together smaller networks all over the globe. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">The</span> <b>Internet</b> was launched in 1969 when the United States funded a project that developed a national computer network called 
                <b>Advanced Research Project Agency Network (ARPANET).</b> <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 3%;">The <b>web</b>,</span> also knwon as <b>World Wide Web (WWW)</b>, is a way of accessing any sort of information over the Internet. It was introduced 
                in 1991. The web provides an easy-to-use interface to Internet resources. It has become everyday tool for all of us to use. Prior to the web, the Internet was all text-no graphics, 
                animations, sounds or video. The web made it possible to include these elements. It provided a multimedia interface to resources available on the Internet. The web has matured through 
                four generations, commonly called Web 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0.
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>Web 1.0</b> focused on linking existing information. Google Search and other search engines made it possible for users to search the web to locate web pages of interest. However, to 
                create a web page required a background in computers and programming. Many users could view web content, but few users could create web content.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Web 2.0</b> evolved to support more dynamic content creation and social interaction. Facebook and other social media sites made an emergence so that non-technical people could be
                seen and heard on the web. These sites allow almost anyone to post videos, images and text about thier lives. However, the massive amount of social media posts made it difficult to 
                find truly valuable information. Many users could view create web content, but few could readily locate valuable, timely information on the web.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Web 3.0</b> is the current generations web. It focuses on applications that automatically prepare personalised content for users. For example, Google now uses data from the web (e.g., 
                and individual's calendar of planned activities, weather reports and traffic reports); searches for interrelationship amoung the data (e.g., the effect of weather and traffic on an individual's 
                daily commute to work) and automatically presents relevant information to the user (e.g., sends an early morning message to the individual's smartphones regarding expected bad weather and/or 
                traffic delays), see Figure 2-1.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Web 4.0</b> is still a premature idea and in its experimental stage. It is also known as <b>WebOS</b> or <b>Symbiotic web</b> and is identified for interaction between humans and machines. 
                It is not wrong to call Web 4.0 as the read-arite-execution-concurrency web. The advantages of Web 4.0 could be: <br>

                &#9673 Building mind-controlled interface <br>
                &#9673 Ability of machine to read, react and decide what to execute <br>
                &#9673 Faster website loading with superior quality <br>
                &#9673 Building more commanding interface <br>
                &#9673 Act as a middleware between human brain and the machine <br>

            <span style="margin-left: 5%;">It</span> is easy to get the Internet and the web confused, but they are not the same thing. The Internet is the physical network. It is made up of wires, cables, 
            satellites and rules for exchanging information between computers connected to the network. Being connected to this network is often described as being <b>online.</b> The Internet connects millions 
            of computers and resources thorughout the world. The web is multimedia interface to the resources available on the Internet and the web. The most common uses of the Internet and the web are listed 
            as follows: <br> <br>

            <li>
                <b>Communicating</b> is by far the most popular Internet activity. You can exhange e-mail, photos and videos with your family and friends almost anywhere in the world. You can locate
