                Utilities are programs that make computing easier. <b>Web Utilities</b> are specialised utility programs that make using the Internet and the web easier and safer. Some of these 
                utilities are browser-related programs that either become part of the browser or axe executed from the browser. Others are designed to protect children from dangerous and inappropriate 
                website material. File transfer utilities allow you to efficiently copy files to and from your computer across the Internet. Internet security suites enhance security and privacy.

                <b>Filters</b> block access to selected sites. The Internet is an interesting and multifacted arena. But not all aspects of the Internet are appropriate for all audiences, Parents, in particular, 
                are concerned about children suffering unrestricted across the Internet. Filter programs allows parents as well as organisations to block out selected sites and set time limits, see Figure 2-6. 
                Additionally, these programs can monitor use and generate reporta detailing the total time spent on the Internet and the time spent at individuals websites. For a list of some of the best-known

            <p>
                Using file transfer utility software, you can copy files to your computer from specially configured servers. This is called <b>downloading</b>. You can also use file transfer utility 
                software to copy files from your computer to another computer on the Internet. This called <b>uploading</b>. Three popular types of file transfer are FTP, web-based and BitTorrent.
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>File transfer Protocol (FTP)</b> and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) allow you to efficiently copy files to and from your computer across the Internet and are frequently used for 
                uploading chnages to a websites hosted by an Internet Service provider. FTP has been used for decades and still remains one of the most methods of file transfer. Most downloads are offered 
                either via HTTP or FTP even today.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Web-based file transfer</b> services make use of a web browser to upload and download files. This eleminates the need for any custom software to be installed. A popular web-based file 
                transfer service is Dropbox.com.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>BitTorrent</b> distributes file transfer across many different computers for more efficient downloads, unlike other transfer technologies whereby a file is copied from one computer 
                on the Internet to another. A single file might be located on several individual computers. When you download the file, each computer send you a tiny piece of the larger file, making
                BitTorrent well suited for transferring very large files. Unfortunately, BitTorrent technology often has been used for distributing unauthorised copies of copyrighted music and video. 
                For a summary of web utilities, refer Table 2-4.

                An <b>Internet security suite</b> is a collection of utility program designed to maintain your security and privacy while you are on the web. These programs control spam, protect against 
                computer viruses, provide filters and much more. You could buy each program separately, however, the cost of the suite is typically much less. Two of the best-known Internet security suites 
                are McAfee's Internet Security and Quick Heal, see Figure 2-7.
