                The web can be an incrediable resource, providing information no nearly any topic imaginable. Are you interested in music? Writing a paper on the environment? Looking for a movie 
                review? Trying to locate a long-lost friend? Information sources related to these questions, and much more, are available on the web. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">With</span> over 20 billion pages and more being added daily, the web is a massive collection of interrelated pages. With so much information available, 
                locating the precise information you need can be difficult. Fortunately, a number of organisation called <b>search services</b> operate websites that can help you locate the information 
                you need. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Search</span> services maintain huge database relating to information provided on the web and the Internet. The information stored at these database 
                include addresses, content descrptions or classifications, and keywords appearing on web pages and other Internet informational resources. Special programs called <i>spiders</i> 
                continually look for new information and update the search services' databases. Additionally, search services provide special programs called <i>search engines</i> that you can use 
                to locate specific information on the web.

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">To</span> use a serach website you enter a keyword or phrase reflecting the information you want. The search engine compares your entry against its database 
                and returns a list of hits, or sites that contain the keywords. Each hit include a link to the referenced web page (or other resource) along with a brief description of the information contained 
                at that location. Many seraches result in large number of hits. For example, if you were to enter the keyword music, you would get billions of hits. Search engine order the hits according to 
                those sites that mosty likely contain the information requested and present the list to you in that order, usually in groups of 10. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Since</span> each search service maintain itw own database, the hits returned by one search engine will not necessarily be the same hits returned by 
                another search engine. Therefore, when researching a topic, it is best to use more than one search engine.

                search engines, refer Table 2-2. For example, let's say you are researching a paper about the environment. You could begin with a general search engine like Google. Or you could go to a 
                search engine that specialises specifically on the environment, such as http://envfor.nic.in/ or http://www.cseindia.org/.

            <h2>ðŸ“¡ Content Evaluation</h2>
            <p>
                Search engine are excellent tools to locate information on the web. be careful, however, how you use the information you find. Unlike most published material found in newspapers, 
                journals and textbooks, not all the information you find on the web has been subjected to strict guidelines to ensure accuracy. In fact, anyone can publish content on the web. Many 
                sites, such as Wikipedia.org, allow anyone to post new material, sometimes anonymously and without critical evaluation. However, such content is checked for factual errors, presence 
                of citations, possibility of promoting someone/some institution by misusing Wikipedia etc. This ensures that the content is periodically sanitised. <br>
                
                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">To</span> evaluate the accuracy of information you find on the web, consider the following:
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>Authority:</b> Is the author an expert in the subject area? Is the site an official site for the information presented, or is the site an individual's personal website?
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Accuracy:</b> Has the information been critically reviewed for correctness prior to posting on the web? Does the website provide a method to report inaccurate information to the 
                author?
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Objectivity:</b> Is the information factually reported or does the author have a bias? Does the author appear to have a personal agenda aimed at convincing or changing the reader's 
                opinion?
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Currency:</b> Is the information up to date? Does the site specify the date when the site was updated? Are the site's links operational? If not, the site is most likely not being 
                actively maintained.
            </li>

            You have to prepare a project report on Duckduckgo search engine with complete details on its advantages and disadvantages over other search engines. Use different search engine to prepare and 
            discuss your report.
