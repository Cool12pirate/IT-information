            <p>
                As previously mentioned, communication is the most popular Internet activity, and its impact cannot be underestimated. At a personal level, friends and family can stay in contact with 
                one another even when separated by thousands of miles. At a business level, electronic communication has become a standard way to stay in touch with suppliers, employees and customers. 
                Some popular types of Internet communications are social networking, blogs, microblogs, webcasts, podcasts, wikis, e-mail and messaging.

                share some common features:

            <p>
                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">A</span> social network often has an overall focus. For example, the largest social networking site, Facebook, tends to be more about, connecting 
                friends and family. Consequently, individuals profiles share personal information, like vacation photo, whereas corporate pages concentrate on developing thier brand and selling thier 
                product. By contrast, LinkedIn is a popular business-oriented social networking site. The profiles on LinkedIn share professional information, like resumes and job successes, and the 
                corporate pages concentrate on sharing thier corporate culture and promoting job openings. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">There</span> are many social networking sites, each with its own unique features and interactions. For a list of some of the most popular sites, refer Table 2-5.

        <div class="dev1">
            <h2>&#8886 Blogs, Microblogs, Webcasts, Podcasts and Wikis &#8887</h2>
            <p>
                In addition to social networking sites, Web 2.0 applications help ordinary people communicate across the web, that includes blogs, microblogs, webcasts, podcasts and wikis. These 
                communication alternatives offer greater flexibility and security; however, they are often more complex to set up and maintain. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Many</span> individuals create personal websites, called <b>blogs</b>, to keep in touch with friends and family Blog postings are time-stamped and 
                arranged with the newest item first. Often, readers of these sites are allowed to comment. Some blogs are like online diaries with personal information; other focus on information 
                about a hobby or theme, such as knitting, electronic devices or good books. Although most are written by individual bloggers, there are also group blogs with multiple contributors. 
                Some businesses and newspapers also have started blogging as a quick publishing method. Several sites provide tools to create blogs. Two of the most widely used are Blogger and WordPress, 
                see Figure 2-9. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">A</span> <b>microblogs</b> publishing short sentences that take only a few seconds to write, rather than long stories or posts like a traditional blog. 
                Microblogs are designed to keep friends and other contacts up to date on your interests and activities. The most popular microblogging site, <b>Twitter,</b> enables you to add new 
                content from your browser, instant messaging application or even a mobile phone. Over 300 million active users send over 500 million Twitter messages, also knwon as <b>tweets,</b> 
                each day. Twitter is popular amoung celebrities and politicians to keep fans up to date on thier moment-to-moment thoughts. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Both</span> webcasts and podcasts devliver media content such as music and movies over the Internet to your computer. <b>Webcasts</b> use <b>streaming 
                technology</b> in which audio and video files are continuously downloaded to your computer while you are listening to and/or viewing the file content. After a webcast has been completed, 
                there are no files remaining on your computer. Webcasts typically broadcast live events. For example, the popular website YouTube.com, as well as other sites, routinely webcast live movie 
                premiers and sporting events.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span style="margin-left: 5%;"><b>Podcasts</b></span> do not use streaming technology. Before a padcast can be run, the media files have to be downloaded and saved to your computer. Once 
                downloaded, the files can be run to listen to music or watch a movie as often as you would like. The media files can also be transferred from your computer to a media player such as an iPod. 
                Podcasts are widely used to download music, tutorials and educational training. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">A</span> <b>wiki</b> is a website designed to allow visitors to use thier browser to add, edit or delete the site's content. 'Wiki' comes from the Hawaiian word 
                for <i>fast</i>, which describes the simplicity of editing and publishing through wiki software. Wikis support collaborative writing in which there isn't a single expert author, but rather 
                a community of interested people that builds knwoledge over time. Perhaps the most famous example is <b>Wikipedia,</b> an online encyclodia, written and edited by anyone who wants to 
                contribute, that has millions of entries in over 20 languages, see Figure 2-10. creating blogs and wikis are examples of web authoring.
