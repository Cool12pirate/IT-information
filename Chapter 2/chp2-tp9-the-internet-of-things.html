            <h1>ðŸ“¶ The Internet Of Things</h1>
            <p>
                The Internet is becoming more and more a part of our lives. The <b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b> is the continuing development of the Internet that allows everyday objects embedded with 
                electronic devices to send and receive data over the Internet. These everyday objects include smartphones, wearable devices and even airconditioner. For example, the fitness bands monitor 
                health data and sends that data to your smartphone or personal web page, see Figure 2-16. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">A</span> web 3.0 application can <b>(1)</b> access the fitness data. <b>(2)</b> combine that data with other data on the web, <b>(3)</b> process the data and 
                <b>(4)</b> send information back to another device. For example, health app, a web 3.0 application, can access your fitness data, combine it with other related health data, analyse the data, 
                and report back to you through your smartphone. These reports provide information about your health, including your heart rate, steps taken each day and an estimate of daily calories burnt. Google's 
                Pixel smartphones also provide many such features. It also has an assistance feature that makes interacting with the phone very easy, see Figure 2-17.
