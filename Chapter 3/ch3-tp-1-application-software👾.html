            <h1>&#9769 Application Software</h1>
            <p>
                Not long ago, trained specialists were required to perform many of the operations you can now do with a personal computer. Market analyse used calculators to project sales. Graphic 
                artists created designs by hand. Data processing clerks created electronic files to be stored on large computers. But now you can do all these tasks-and many others-with personal 
                computer and appropriate application software. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">There</span> are two kinds of software. <b>System software</b> works with end user, application software, and computer hardware to handle the majority 
                of technical details. <b>Application software</b> can be described as end user software and is used to accomplish a variety of tasks. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Application</span> software can further be divided into three categories. One category, <b>general-purpose applications,</b> include word processing 
                programs, spreadsheets, presentation graphics packages, etc. Another category, <b>specialised applications,</b> include thousands of other programs that tend to be more narrowly 
                focused and used in specific disciplines and occupations. For exmaple, designers and advertising agencies use CorelDraw, Photoshop, GIMP, Inkscape, InDesign, etc. while NetSuite ERP, 
                Zoha books, Busy, Marg, Saral and Tally, etc. are accounting softwares. The third category, <b>mobile apps,</b> comprises add-on features on programs typically designed for smartphones and 
                tablets. These apps can be general purpose or specialised and range from general purpose images editing apps like Snapseed, TouchRetouch, Enlight, Pixlr to health monitoring apps like 
                Google Fit, Pacer, Pedometer, runkeeper, etc. There are also specialised apps like VoLT, PowerVocab, A Word A DayWidget, for vocabulary learning; netbanking apps like pocket, maps and 
                navigation apps like Google Maps and Productivity apps like, PhoneClean, Google drive.

            <h2>üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è User Interface</h2>
            <p>
                A <b>user interface</b> is that portion of the application which allows you to control and interact with the program. Depending on the application, you can use a mouse, a pointer, a keyboard, 
                and/or your voice to communicate with the application. Most general-purpose applications use a mouse and a <b>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</b> that displays graphical elements called <b>icons</b> 
                to represent familiar objects. The mouse controls a pointer on the screen that is used to select items such a icons. Nowadays you can also use devices such as microphone to give voice instructions 
                to computers. Another feature is the use of windiws to display information. A <b>window</b> is simply a rectangular area that can contain a document, program, or message. (Do not confuse 
                the term <i>windows</i> with the various versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system, which is a program.) More than one window can be opened and displayed on the computer screen at 
                one time. <br>

                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Traditionally,</span> most software programs use a system of menus, toolbars, abd dialog boxes, see Figure 3-1.
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>Menus</b> present commands that are typically displayed in a <b>menu bar</b> at the top of the screen. 
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Toolbars</b> typically appear below the menu bar and include small graphic elements called <b>buttons</b> that provide shortcuts for quick access to commonly used commands. These can 
                be multiple toolbars is an application, e.g., picture toolbar and text toolbar.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Dialog boxes</b> provide additional information and request user input.
            </li>

            <p>
                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">Many</span> applications, and Microsoft applications in particular, use an interface known as the Ribbon GUI to make it easier to find and use all the 
                features of an application; this GUI uses a system of ribbons, tabs, and galleries, see Figure 3-2.
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>Ribbons</b> replace menus and toolbars by organising commonly used commands into a set of tabs. These tabs display command buttons that are most relevant to the tasks being 
                performed by the user.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Tabs</b> are used to divide the ribbon into major activity areas. Each tab is then organised into <b>groups</b> that contain related items. Some tabs, called <b>contextual tabs,</b> 
                appear only when they are needed and anticipate the next operation to be performed by the user.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Galleries</b> simplify the process of making a selection from a list of alternatives. This is accomplished by graphically displaying the effect of alternatives before being selected.

            <h2>üü¶ Common Features</h2>
            <p>
                Most applications provide a variety of features to make entering/presenting, editing and formatting documents easy. Some of the most common features include:
            </p>
