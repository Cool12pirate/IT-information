            If you don't have the appropriate secondary storage, your computer will slow down, your digital camera won't
            take pictures, and your phone won't be able to run apps. In the future, that will likely not be a problem as
            we will see storage types can hold the entire UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India) data on a
            single disk as small as a coin and store information in holograms or even organic molecules. <br>
            This page covers the things you need know to be prepared for this ever-changing digital world, including:

            â–¶ Kunal has to organise a cultural event in his college for which needs to collect some songs on his laptop.
            He thinks of taking a backup of the songs, in sequence, in a pendrive. Kunal has the added responsibility of
            taking photographs and videos of the event. He has to share the files with a videographer to create a film
            after mixing and editing. He realises that the data would be extremely heavy and cannot be stored in the pen
            drive. To this his friedn suggests he should use a hard disk instead of a pen drive. Kunal is now happy that
            his data would be safe and all of them can be stored in one place.
