        <h2>Optical Disc</h2>
        <p>
            Today's <b>optical disc</b> can hold over 128 gigabytes of data, see Figure 7-10. That is the equivalent of
            millions of typewritten pages or a medium-sized library all on a single disc. Optical disc are very common,
            with most software and many movies available on optical disc. In optical disc technology, a laser beam
            alters the surface of a plastic or metalic disc to represent data. Unlike hard disks, which use magnetic
            charges to represent 1s and 0s, optical disc use reflected light. The 1s and 0s are representated by flat
            areas called <b>lands</b> and bumpy areas called <b>pits</b> on the disc surface. The disc is read by an
            <b>optical disc drive</b> using a laser that projects a tiny beam of light on these areas. The amount of
            reflected light determines whether the area represents a 1 or a 0. Like hard disks, optical discs use tracks
            and sectors to organise and store files. Unlike the concentric tracks and wedge-shaped sectors used for hard
            disks, however, optical disc typically use a single track that spirals outward from the center of the disc.
            The single track is divided into equal-sized sectors. The most widely used optical disc are CD, DVD, and
            Blu-ray discs.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Compact disc (CDs)</b> were the first widely available optical format for PC users. Typically, CD
            drives store 700 MB (megabytes) of storage. Optical discs that store music are often CDs.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Digital versatile discs (DVDs)</b> are the standard optical discs in PCs. DVDs are very similar to CDs
            expect that typical DVD discs can store 4.7 GB (gigabyte)-seven times the capacity of CDs. Optical disc that
            store movies or software can often DVDs. DVD drives and CD drives look very similar.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Blu-ray discs (BDs)</b> are the newest form of optical storage designed to store <b>hi def (high
                definition)</b> video, which uses the HD 720 and HD 1080 resolution discussed in <a
                style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none;"
                href="file:///C:/Users/user/Documents/Chapter%206/chp6-index.html"> Input and Output </a>. The name
            Blu-ray comes from a special blue-coloured laser used to read the disc that gives them a typical capacity of
            50 GB-ten times the capacity of DVDs. Optical discs that store hi def video and the newest video games are
            often Blu-ray discs. Each of these optical discs has three basic formats: read only, write once, and
            rewritable.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Read-only (ROM</b> or <b>Read-Only Memory) discs</b> are discs that cannot be written on or erased by
            the user. Optical disc that you buy in a store, such as music CDs, DVD movies, and Blu-ray video games, are
            often read only.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Write-once (R</b> for <b>recordable) discs</b> can be written on once. After that, the disc can be read
            many times but cannot be written on or erased. These discs are ideal for creating permanent archives, such
            as CD-R, often used for storing family photos, and DVD-R, often used to store home movies.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Rewritable</b> <b>(RW</b> for <b>rewritable</b> or <b>RAM</b> for <b>random-access memory)</b> disc are
            similar to write-once discs except that the disc surface is not permanently altered when data is recorded.
            The changeable, portable storage options are portable for storing and sharing audio, video, and large
            multimedia presentations. For a summary of the different types of optical discs, refer Table 7-2.

            Are you concerned about damaging your optical discs? Actually, they are quite durable, and taking care of them boils down to just a few basic rules. <br>
            <b>1.</b> <b>Don't stack</b>: Dont't stack or bend discs. <br>
            <b>2.</b> <b>Don't touch</b>: Don't touch the recording surfaces. Hold only by thier edges. <br>
            <b>3.</b> <b>Don't remove</b>: Never attempt to remove a disc when it is rotating and is use. <br>
            <b>4.</b> <b>Avoid extreme conditions</b>: Keep discs from extreme heat and direct sunlight. <br>
            <b>5.</b> <b>Use storage boxes</b>: Store disc in plastic storage boxes. <br>

            Of course, the best protection is to make a backup or duplicate copy of your disc.
