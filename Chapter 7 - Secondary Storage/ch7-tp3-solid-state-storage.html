        <h2>Solid-State Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike hard disks, which rotate and have read/write heads that move in and out, solid-state storage device
            have no moving parts. Data and information are stored and retrieved electronically directly from these
            devices much as they would be from conventional computer memory. Solid-state storage devices provide access
            to <b>flash memory</b>, also known as <b>solid-state storage.</b> As we discussed in <a
                style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;"
                href="file:///C:/Users/user/Documents/Chapter%205%20-%20System%20Unit/chp5-tp1-systemunit-index.html">System
                Unit</a>, flash memory offers a combination of features of RAM and ROM. Like RAM it can be updated and
            like ROM it does not lose information when a computer is turned off. Flash memory is a little slower than
            traditional memory but much faster than traditional hard disks.
        </p>

            <span class="envo-h">Environment ðŸŒ´</span> <br>
            Did you know that traditional, magnetic hard disk storage require more energy than solid-state storage?
            Unlike solid-state drives, which have no moving parts, hard drives have to rotate thier magnetic disk in
            order to save retrieve data. Fujitsu, which manufractures various storage devices, estimates that its
            high-end solid-state drives will consume 40 percent less power than comparable hard drives. For large data
            centers, this can result in a significant reduction in energy needs.

        <h3>Solid-State Drive</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Solid-state Drive (SSDs)</b> are designed to be connected inside a personal computer system the same way
            an internal hard disk would be put contain solid-state memory instead of magnetic disks to store data, see
            Figure 7-7. SSDs are faster and more durable than hard disks. SSDs also require less power, which can lead
            to increased battery life for laptops and mobile devices. SSDs are more expensive and generally have a lower
            capacity than hard disks, continues to increase. SSDs are widely used in tablets, smartphones, and other
            mobile devices. Computer manufractures have developed hybrid systems that contain both SSDs and magnetic
            disks in an attempt to gain the speed and power benefits of SSDs while still having lower cost and large
            capacity of magnetic hard drives. Typically, these systems store the operating system and applications on
            the SSD drive and videos, music, documents, and folders on the magnetic hard drives.

        <h3>Flash Memory Cards</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Flash Memory Cards</b> are small solid-state storage devices widely used in portable devices. Some of the
            cards are used within devices such as laptops, smartphones, and GPS navigation systems, see Figure 7-8.
            Other cards provide removeable storage. For example, flash memory is used to store images captured from
            digital cameras and then to transfer the images to desktop and other computers. Flash memory is used in
            digital media players like the iPad to store and play music and video files.

        <h3>USB Drives</h3>
        <p>
            <b>USB Drives</b>, or flash drives, are so compact that can be transported on a key ring, see Figure 7-9.
            These drives conveniently connect directly to a computer's USB port to transfer files and can have
            capacities ranging from 1 GB to 256 GB, with a board price range to match. Due to thier convenient size and
            large capacities, USB drives have become very popular option for transporting data and information between
            computers, speciality devices, and the Internet.

            <span class="tip-h">Tips</span> <br>
            Have you ever accidentally defeated or lost important files from your flash drive? Do you have a USB flash
            drive that is no longer being recognised by your computer? Here are a few suggestions that might help: <br>

            <b>1. Recovery/undelete software:</b> If you accidentally deleted files from a USB drive, it is unlikely
            that you can recover them using your operating system or searching through your recycle bin. Fortunately,
            there are several recovry (or undelete) programs that might help, and some even free. For example, two free
            programs are <em>Undelete 360</em> and <em>Recuva</em>. These programs will scan your flash drives for
            deleted files and offer you a chance to recover the ones you want back. <br>

            <b>2. Testing USB ports:</b> If your computer does not recognise your USB flash drive, there could be a
            problem with your USB port. Try plugging another device into the same port to see if it works. If this
            device does not work, then your computer's USB is most likely defective and needs to be replaced. If the
            device works, the most likely you USB flash drive is damaged and you should try the professional recovery
            service discussed in the next step. <br>

            <b>3. Professional recovery services:</b> For damaged flash drives, there is a possibility that your data
            could be recovered by several companies that are dedicated to data recovery. Altough fees are high, they can
            rescue data from the actual memory chip, even if the drive or supporting circuits are damaged.
