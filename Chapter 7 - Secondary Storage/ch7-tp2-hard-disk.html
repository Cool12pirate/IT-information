        <h2>Hard Disk</h2>
        <p>
            Hard disks save files by altering the magnetic charges of the disk's surface to represent 1s and 0s. Hard
            disks retrieve data and programs by reading these charges from the magnetic disc. Characters are represented
            by positive (+) and negative (-) charges using the ASCII, EBCDIC, or Unicode binary codes. For example, the
            letter A would require a series of 8 charges, see Figure 7-2. <b>Density</b> refers to how tightly these
            charges can be packed next to one another on disk. <b>Hard disks</b> use rigid metalic <b>platters</b> that
            are stacked one on top of another. Hard disks store and organise files using tracks, sectors, and cylinders.
            <b>Tracks</b> are rings of concentratic circles on the platter. Each track is divided into invisible
            wedge-shaped sections called <b>sectors</b>, see Figure 7-3. A <b>cylinder</b> runs through each track of a
            stack of platters. Cylinders are necessary to differentiate files stored on the same track and sector of
            different platters. When a hard disk formatted tracks, sectors, and cylinders are assigned. Hard disks are
            sensitive instruments. Thier read/write heads are surrounded by air which is about 0.000001 inch thick. It
            is so thin that a smoke particle, fingerprint dust, or human hair could case what is known as a head crash,
            see Figure 7-4. A <b>Head crash</b> occurs when a read-write head makes contact with the hard disk's surface
            or with particles on its surface. A head crash is a disaster for a hard disk. The disc surface is scratched,
            and some or all of the data is destroyed. At one time, head crashes were commonplace. Now fortunately, they
            are rare. There are two basic types of hard disks: internal and external.

        <h3>Internal Hard Disk</h3>
        <p>
            An <b>Internal hard disk</b> is located inside the system unit. There hard disks are able to store and
            retrieve large quantities of information quickly. They are used to store programs and data files. For
            example, nearly every personal computer uses its internal hard disk to store its operating system and major
            applications such as Word and Excel. To ensure adequate performance of your internal hard disk and the
            safety of your data, you should perform routine maintenance and periodically make backup copies of all
            important files. For hard disk maintenance and backup procedures. refer to the section on Windows utilities
            Disc Cleanup and Optimise Drivers in the book.
        </p>

        <h3>External Hard Drives</h3>
        <p>
            While internal hard disks provide faster acess. They have a fixed amount of storage and cannot be easily
            removed from the system unit. External hard disks provide slower access and are typically connected to a USB
            for Thunderblot port on the system unit can be easily removed. Like an internal hard disk, external hard
            disks have a fixed amount of storage. However, since each removable hard disk can be easily replaced by
            another removable hard disk, a single port on the system unit can provide access to an unlimited amount of
            storage, see Figure 7-5. <b>External hard drives</b> use the same basic technology as internal hard disks
            and are used primarily to complement an internal hard disk. Because they are removable, they are
            particularly useful to protect or secure sensitive information. Other uses external drives include backing
            up the contents of the internal hard disk and providing additional hard disk capacity.
        </p>

        <h3>Performance Enhancements</h3>
        <p>

            Three ways to improve teh performance of hard disks are disc caching, redundant arrays of inexpensive disc,
            and file compression/decompression. <b>Disc caching</b> improves hard disk performance by anticipating data
            needs. It performs a function similar to cache memory discussed in ....... . While cache memory improves
            processing by acting as a temporary high-speed holding area between memory and the CPU, disc caching
            improves processing by acting as a temporary high-speed holding area between a secondary storage device and
            the CPU. Disc caching requires a combination of hardware and software. During idle processing time,
            frequently used data is automatically identified and read from the hard disk into the disk cache. When
            needed, the data is then accessed directly from memory. The transfer rate from memory is much faster than
            from the hard disk. As a result, overall system performance is often increased by as much as 30 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)</b> improve performance by expanding external storage,
            improving access speed, and providing reliable storage. Several inexpensive hard disk drives are connected
            to one another. These connections can be by a network or within specialised RAID devices, see Figure 7-6.
            The connected hard disk drives are related or grouped together, and the computer system interacts with the
            RAID system as though it were a single large-capacity hard disk drive. The result is expanded storage
            capability, fast access speed, and high reliability. For these reasons, RAID is often used by Internet
            servers and large organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>File compression</b> and <b>file decompression</b> increase storage capacity by reducing the amount of
            space required to store data and programs. File compression is not limited to hard disk systems. It is
            frequently used to compress files on DVDs, CDs, and flash drives as well. File compression also helps to
            speed up transmission of files from one computer system to another. Sending and receiving compressed files
            across the Internet is a common activity. File compression programs scan files for ways to reduce the amount
            of required storage. One way is to search for repeating patterns. The repeating patterns are replaced with a
            token, leaving enough tokens so that the original can be rebuilt or decompressed. These programs often
            shrink files to a quarter of thier original size. Windows and Mac operating systems provide compression and
            decompression utilities. For more advanced compression schemes, you can use specialised utility such as
            WinZip. For a summary of performance enhancement techniques, refer Table 7-1.
        </p>

        <p class="pri-b">
            <span class="pri-h">Privacy</span> <br>
            Diminishing secondary storage prices have an unexpected impact on privacy. The availability of cheap digital
            storage has resulted in a permanent digital record of our lives available for all to see on the Internet.
            Once an image, video, or message is released on the Internet, it is very difficult very difficult to remove.
            Some argue that we all have a "right to be forgotten" and that major Internet compaines like Facebook and
            Google should help people permanently remove records of embarrassing or unpleasant moments. Others say that
            the Internet is a record of our past and we can't choose to only hold on to the positive things. What do you
            think?

            Does your internal hard disk run a lot and seem slow? The problem could be with fragmented files-files, when
            saved were broken into pieces (fragments) and stored in different locations on your hard disk, which take
            longer for the hard disk to access. Defragging rearranges the file parts so they stored in adjacent
            locations. To clean up the disk and speed up access times, consider defragmenting. <br> <br>

            <b>1.</b> <b>Start Disk Defragmenter</b>: Type <em>disk defrag</em> into the Start menu search box and press
            Enter to open the Disk Defragmenter utility. Click <em>Defragment</em> disk to begin defragmenting your
            disk. <br>

            <b>2.</b> <b>Keep working</b>: You can contnue running other applications while your disk is being
            defragmented. But, then, your computer operates more slowly, and Disk Defragmenter takes longer to finish.
            <br>

            <b>3.</b> <b>Automate</b>: Windows will defragments your disk for you automatically. Click <em>Configure
            schedule</em> in the Disk Defragmenter utility to set this to a time that is convenient for you.
