        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p>
            As essential feature of every computer is the ability to save, or store, information. As discussed
            previously, Random Access Memory (RAM) holds or stores data and programs that the CPU is presently
            processing. Before data can be processed or a programs that the CPU is presently processing. Before data can
            be processed or a program can be run, it must be in RAM. For this reason, RAM is sometimes referred to as
            <b>primary storage</b>. Unfortunately, RAM provides only temporary or volatile storage. That is, it loses
            all of its contents as soon as the computer is turned off. Its contents also are lost if there is a power
            faluire that disrupts the electric current going into the system unit. The volatility results in a need for
            permanent or non-volatile storage for data and programs. We also need external storage because users need
            much more storage capacity than is typically available in a computer's primary or RAM memory. <b>Secondary
                storage</b> provides permanent or non-volatile storage. <b>Secondary storage devices</b>, such as a hard
            disk drive, retains data and programs even after the computer has been shut off. This is accomplished by
            <em>writing</em> files to and <em>reading</em> files from secondary storage devices. Writing is the process
            of saving information to the secondary storage device. Reading is the process of accessing information
            <em>from</em> secondary storage. Secondary storage devices have always been an indispensable element in any
            computer system. They have similarities to output and input devices. Like output devices secondary storage
            devices receive information from the system unit in the form of the machine language of 0s and 1s. Rather
            than translating the information, secondary storage devices save the information in machine language for
            later use. Like input devices, secondary storage devices send information, since it is already in machine
            form, does not need to be translated. It is sent directly to memory (RAM), where it can be accessed and
            processed by the CPU. Some important characteristics of secondary storage are:
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Media</b> are the physical material that holds the data and programs, see Figure 7-1.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Capacity</b> measure how much a particular storage medium can hold.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Storage devices</b> are hardware that reads data and programs from storage media. Most also write to
            storage media.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Access speed</b> measures the amount of time required by the storage device retrieve data and programs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most desktop personal computer systems have hard disk optical disc drives, as well as ports where additional
            storage devices can be connected.
