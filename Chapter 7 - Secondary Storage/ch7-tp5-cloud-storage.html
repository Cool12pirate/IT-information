        <h2>Cloud Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Recently, many applications that would have required installation on your computer to run have moved to the
            web. As we discussed in ---Chapter 2---, this is known as <b>cloud computing</b>, where the Internet acts as
            a 'cloud' of server that supply applications to clients as a service rather than a product. Additionally,
            these servers provide <b>cloud storage</b>, also known as <b>online storage</b>. If you have used Google
            Suite to create a word proceessing document or a spreadsheet, you have already used cloud computing, see
            Figure 7-11. The service provider's server runs the application and your computer displays results. This
            applications and data can be accessed from any Internet-ready device. This means that even devices with
            little storage, memory, or processing power, such as a smartphone, can run the same powerful applications as
            a desktop computer. The benefits to this arrangement are numerous:
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Maintenance :</b> The cloud service will take care of disk defragmentation, backups, encryption, and
            security.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Hardware upgrades :</b> The cloud service will never run out of disc space and can replace failed hard
            disks without interruption to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>File sharing and collaboration :</b> Users can share documents, spreadsheets, and files with others
            from anywhere with an Internet connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, there are some disadvantages of cloud storage:
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Access speed :</b> The data transfer rate is dependent upon the speed of your Internet connection,
            which most likely is not as fast as user's internal network.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚óè <b>File security :</b> Users are dependent upon the cloud service's security procedures, which may not be
            as effective as your own. There are numerous websites that provide cloud storage services, refer Table 7-3.

            Cloud storage has created some interesting legal and ethical questions regarding the storage of sensitive
            and privileged information. Who is responsible for maintaining security and privacy of sensitive and
            confidental information? Waht if your attorney or doctor stored confidential information about you in the
            cloud and it somehow become widely distributed across the Internet? Clearly, you suffer any related
            consequences, but who is responsible? Is it your attorney, your doctor, the company providing the cloud
            service, or do you somehow have the responsibility to protect personal sensitive information?
