        <h2>Mass Storage Devices</h2>
        <p>
            It is natural to think of secondary storage media and devices as they relate to use an individuals. It may
            not be as obvious how important these matters are to organisations. <b>Mass storage</b> refers to the
            tremendous amount of secondary storage required by large organisations. <b>Mass storage devices</b> are
            specialised high-capacity secondary storage devices designed to meet organisational demands for data
            storage. These mass storage solutions allow large corporations and institutions to centralise thier
            maintenance and security of data, thereby reducing costs and personal.
        </p>

        <h3>Enterprise Storage System</h3>
        <p>
            Most large organisations have established a strategy called an enterprise storage system to promote
            efficient and safe use of data across the networks within thier organisations, see Figure 7-12. Some of the
            mass storage devices that support this strategy are:
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>File servers:</b> Dedicated computers with very large storage capacities that provide users access to
            fast storage and retrieval of data.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Network Attached Storage (NAS):</b> A type of file server designed for homes and small businesses. NAS
            is less expensive, easier to manage than most file servers. However, it does not include powerful management
            tools and features found in many large-scale file servers.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>RAID systems:</b> Larger versions of the specialised devices discussed earlier that enhance
            organisational security by constantly making backup copies of files moving across the organisation's
            networks.
        </p>

        <p>
            ‚óè <b>Organisational cloud storage:</b> High-speed Internet connection to a dedicated remote storage
            facility. These facilities contain banks of file server to offer enormous amounts of storage.
        </p>

        <h3>Storage Area Network</h3>
        <p>
            A recent mass storage development in <b>storage area network (SAN)</b> systems. SAN is an architecture to
            link remote computer storage devices, such as enterprise storage systems, to computers such that the devices
            are as available as locally attached drives. In a SAN systems, the user's computer provide the file system
            for storing data, but the SAN provides the disk space for data. The key to a SAN is a high-speed network,
            connecting individual computers to mass storage devices. Special file systems prevent simultaneous users fro
            interfering with each other. SANs provide the ability to house data in remote locations and still allow
            efficient and secure access.
